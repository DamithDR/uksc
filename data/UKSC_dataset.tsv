2024	uksc-2021-0098	Lipton and another (Respondents) v BA Cityflyer Ltd (Appellant)	This appeal concerns a claim for compensation in respect of a cancelled flight. Although the sum at stake is small, the decision has the potential to affect tens of thousands of claims which are made annually under the applicable legislation. It also addresses important questions regarding the status of accrued EU law rights. The respondents, Mr and Mrs Lipton, were booked onto a flight from Milan Linate Airport to London City Airport on 30 January 2018 operated by the appellant airline, Cityflyer. The flight was cancelled because the pilot did not report for work due to illness and it was not possible to find a replacement pilot. The Liptons were rebooked onto a replacement flight and landed in London just over 2.5 hours later than scheduled. The Liptons claimed against Cityflyer for €250 (about £220) under Regulation (EC) 261/2004 of 11 February 2004 (“Regulation 261”). Regulation 261 entitles passengers to compensation for cancelled flights. Airlines have a defence if they can show that the cancellation was the result of “extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken”. Cityflyer refused to pay on the ground that the pilot falling ill was an extraordinary circumstance. The Liptons’ claim was dismissed by a Deputy District Judge in the Portsmouth County Court, and on appeal by a Circuit Judge at the Winchester County Court. The Liptons then appealed to the Court of Appeal, which determined that the defence was not made out and upheld the claim. Cityflyer now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Cityflyer’s appeal. It holds that the pilot falling ill did not amount to an extraordinary circumstance within the meaning of Regulation 261. Lord Sales and Lady Rose give the leading judgment, with which Lady Simler agrees. Lord Burrows gives a concurring judgment agreeing with the leading judgment. Lord Lloyd-Jones gives a concurring judgment agreeing as to the result but disagreeing with the reasoning regarding accrued EU law rights.	Issue 1 - What law applies? An important question raised by this appeal is what law applies to a cause of action that accrued under an EU regulation prior to Brexit. On the date of the Liptons’ flight, the UK had not yet left the EU. At that point in time, the EU text of Regulation 261 applied in the UK by virtue of section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972 (“ECA 1972”). By the date of the Court of Appeal hearing, the UK had left the EU and the ECA 1972 had been repealed by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA 2018”). Whilst it is common ground that these subsequent events did not extinguish the Liptons’ accrued cause of action, the parties disagree about why that is and what law now applies to their claim [48]-[50]. Answering those questions requires the Supreme Court to examine the domestic legislation which implemented Brexit. EUWA 2018 provided for certain EU enactments and rights to remain in domestic law after 31 December 2020 (“IP completion day”), which was the end of the implementation period during which EU law applied in the UK. These are known as “retained EU law”. In particular, section 3 of EUWA 2018 provides that EU regulations “operative immediately before” IP completion day remain in domestic law as retained EU law [51]-[55]. Section 4 provides that certain rights and liabilities which were enforceable under section 2(1) of the ECA 1972 continue to be available in domestic law after IP completion day. On IP completion day, Regulation 261 was amended by the Passenger Flights and Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the “Amended Regulation”) [33]-[34]. By the date of the Court of Appeal hearing, the Amended Regulation was in force. The Supreme Court unanimously holds that the Court of Appeal was wrong to apply the Amended Regulation to the Liptons’ claim [66], [186], [193]. A basic principle of the rule of law is that the applicable law is that in force at the time an event occurs. There is nothing to suggest that the Amended Regulation was intended to apply to fact patterns arising before it came into force. As regards what law does apply, there are two alternative analyses which could explain how the Liptons’ cause of action was carried forward post-IP completion day [59]: a. The “Complete Code analysis”: EUWA 2018 dealt comprehensively with the application in the UK of EU law following IP completion day. Where a cause of action arose in relation to events that took place pre-IP completion day, that cause of action is brought forward as retained EU law by EUWA 2018. b. The “Interpretation Act analysis”: EUWA 2018 transposed into domestic law certain rules of EU law with prospective effect but left undisturbed any cause of action that accrued under EU law prior to IP completion day, save where it expressly provided to the contrary. Such causes of action are saved by the application of section 16 of the Interpretation Act 1978, which provides that the repeal of an enactment does not affect any right accrued under that enactment, unless the contrary intention appears. A majority of the Supreme Court finds that the Complete Code analysis is correct [83], [93]. Regulation 261 was operative immediately before IP completion day in two ways: (i) by stipulating the law to be applied to any new situations; and (ii) by requiring any causes of action that had accrued under Regulation 261 to be recognised and enforced by domestic courts [86]. Section 3 of EUWA 2018 was effective to bring forward both these aspects as retained EU law. This accords with the fundamental purpose of EUWA 2018, which was to provide comprehensively for a post-Brexit legal landscape. It is implausible that the ongoing enforcement of pre-Brexit accrued causes of action was intended to fall outside the new domestic regime [87]-[88]. The relevant text of Regulation 261 for the Liptons’ claim is the EU text as it stood immediately before IP completion day. The Interpretation Act analysis would generate a number of serious problems [106]-[115]. In particular, it is unclear how section 6 of EUWA 2018, which makes important provision regarding the status of decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”), would apply. The heading of section 6 suggests that it only applies to the interpretation of retained EU law, which would not include an accrued cause of action on the Interpretation Act analysis. By contrast, the Complete Code analysis makes clear that: (i) courts are not bound by decisions of the CJEU which are handed down post-IP completion day but may have regard to them; and (ii) the Supreme Court (and certain other appellate courts) are not bound by pre-IP completion day rulings of the CJEU and may depart from them. Lord Burrows agrees that the Complete Code analysis is correct [175]. Accrued EU law rights exist after IP completion day as retained EU law and not as part of a separate body of law. The Interpretation Act analysis would give alarming and illogical answers to fundamental practical questions about the status of accrued EU law rights [190]. Lord Lloyd-Jones concludes that the Interpretation Act analysis is correct [193]. There was no need for EUWA 2018 to preserve accrued rights and obligations as they were automatically preserved by the operation of the Interpretation Act [204]. There is a general legal presumption that legislation does not operate retrospectively. The text of EUWA 2018 and the relevant background do not evidence a clear intention to displace that presumption and disturb established rights and obligations. It is significant that there is nothing in the Explanatory Notes to EUWA 2018 to support the Complete Code analysis [202]. The language of sections 2, 3 and 4 of EUWA 2018 is not apt to achieve the transposition of accrued causes of action into retained EU law [206]-[217]. The Complete Code analysis may result in a claim being governed other than by the law in force at the date the cause of action accrued [218]-[222]. Further, the Complete Code analysis is difficult to reconcile with the Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the EU, which states that EU law shall apply in the UK during the transition period [223]-[227]. Section 6 of the EUWA 2018 is not necessarily inconsistent with the Interpretation Act analysis whereas the Complete Code analysis is difficult to reconcile with the power to depart under section 6(4) [228]-[243]. Issue 2 – Was the pilot falling ill an extraordinary circumstance? Cityflyer bears the burden of proving that the captain’s non-attendance due to illness fell within the concept of extraordinary circumstances [160]. The meaning of the phrase must be interpreted in light of the purpose of Regulation 261, which is to ensure a high level of protection for consumers. The basic principles regarding the application of the defence are well-settled [137]. The principal question is whether the relevant event is inherent in the normal activity of the carrier [145]. The Supreme Court unanimously holds that the pilot’s non-attendance due to illness was an inherent part of Cityflyer’s activity as an air carrier and cannot be categorised as extraordinary [160], [174], [193]. That phrase must be given its usual meaning, which denotes something out of the ordinary. Staff illness is commonplace for any business. Just as the wear and tear of an aircraft’s physical components is considered an inherent part of an air carrier’s activity, so too is managing illness of staff [165]. An event can be external to a carrier but still inherent to its operations [166]. It is irrelevant whether staff fall ill whilst they are off-duty; their attendance or non-attendance for work is an inherent part of the carrier’s operating system. It is significant that pilots are subject to rules outside their working hours, such as a ban on drinking in the lead-up to a flight [170]. Regulation 261 is intended to provide a standardised level of compensation for passengers which does not require complex analysis. Requiring an enquiry into why, when and how a staff member became ill would be contrary to the intended operation of the scheme [171]-[172].			
2024	uksc-2021-0130	Potanina (Respondent) v Potanin (Appellant)	Courts in England and Wales have the power under Part III of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 (‘1984 Act’) to grant financial remedies after an overseas divorce. Before granting such a remedy, the court must consider whether it would be appropriate for a court in England and Wales to do so having regard to factors which include the connections of the parties with England and Wales, with the country in which they were divorced and with any other country. Section 13 of the 1984 Act provides that no application under Part III for a financial remedy may be made unless the permission of the court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court; and that the court shall not give permission unless it considers that there is “substantial ground” for making the application for a financial remedy. The parties to this case are both Russian citizens who, until the wife took up residence in London after their divorce, had both lived in Russia all their lives, as the husband still does. They were both born in Russia in 1961, were married in Russia in 1983 and their marriage was dissolved by a Russian court in 2014. Initially they were not well off but, since the 1990s, the husband has accumulated vast wealth. Their divorce was followed by extensive litigation in the Russian courts about the division of assets. The final outcome of this litigation was that the wife received half the value of the assets owned by the husband. But the award left out of account most of the wealth accumulated by the husband, which is held by various trusts and companies. Such assets were not regarded by the Russian courts as marital assets. Immediately after the couple were divorced in 2014 the wife obtained a UK investor visa and bought a flat in London. Since 2017 she has been habitually resident in England. In 2018 she applied for permission to seek a financial remedy under Part III of the 1984 Act. Under the applicable rules of court in the Family Division of the High Court, the permission application must be made without notice to the other party unless the court directs that the other party should be notified of the application. If an application made without notice is granted, the rules of court then give the other party when served with the court’s order the right to apply to the court to set aside or vary the order which was made without notice. The wife’s application in this case for permission under Section 13 was made and heard by the judge without notice to the husband and without him being aware of the application. The judge granted permission. After the court’s order was served on him, the husband applied to have it set aside. After a hearing at which both parties were represented, the judge decided that he had been materially misled at the first hearing and that, considering the matter afresh after hearing argument from both sides, the test for granting permission under Section 13 was not met (mainly because the connection of the parties with Russia was infinitely greater than their connection with England and Wales). The judge therefore set aside his original order and refused the wife permission to apply for a financial remedy under Part III. The wife appealed against this decision to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal took the law to be that the power to set aside may only be exercised where there is some “compelling reason” to do so and in practice only where the court has been misled. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal held that it must be possible to demonstrate such a compelling reason by a “knock-out blow”. They concluded that on the facts of this case the judge had not been materially misled at the initial hearing. It followed that the judge had not been entitled to set aside his original order granting permission, which should therefore be restored. The husband now appeals to the Supreme Court.	By a majority of three to two, the Supreme Court allows the appeal. Lord Leggatt gives the leading judgment, with which Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lady Rose agree. Lord Briggs gives a dissenting judgment, with which Lord Stephens agrees.	It is a fundamental rule of procedural fairness that, before making an order requested by one party, the judge must give the other party the chance to object. If for some reason it is not practicable to do this, the judge must do the next best thing, which is - if the judge makes the order - to give the other party an opportunity to argue that the order should be set aside or varied. What is always unfair is to make a final order, only capable of correction on appeal, after hearing only from the party who wants you to make the order without allowing the other party to say why the order should not be made [1]. The test applied by the Court of Appeal led to the patently unfair and perverse result that, because the husband could not demonstrate by a “knockout blow” that the judge had been materially misled at the first hearing held without notice to him, the judge was not entitled to hear any argument from the husband on the question whether the test for granting permission under Section 13 was met or to set aside the order made after hearing from the wife alone. This in turn meant that the judge’s original order granting permission was restored, despite the fact that, after hearing argument from both sides, the judge had concluded that the test for granting permission was not satisfied [4], [28]. The law does not require this approach, which is inconsistent with the relevant rules of court. The rules give a party served with an order made without notice to him the right to apply to have the order set aside on the ground that the test for granting permission under Section 13 is not met. There is no requirement to show a “compelling reason” or to show that the court was materially misled or to deliver a “knock-out blow” [34]–[39]. The source of these supposed requirements is some guidance given by the Supreme Court in a case in 2010, which the Court of Appeal subsequently endorsed. However, this guidance was not binding as the test and procedure for dealing with applications for permission under Section 13 was not in issue in those cases and the court heard no argument on the point. Furthermore, the guidance was based on a misunderstanding of a suggestion previously made by several judges and on a false analogy with the procedure for dealing with applications for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal [49]–[75]. The practice currently being followed on the basis of this guidance is unlawful as it is contrary to the applicable rules of court and to a fundamental principle of procedural justice [85]. The correct position therefore is that, if a court makes an order granting permission under Section 13 after hearing from the applicant alone and without notice to the other party, the other party has an absolute unfettered right to apply to have the order set aside. At the hearing of such an application to set aside, the onus remains on the party requiring permission under Section 13 to show a “substantial ground” for making the application for a financial remedy in England and Wales. In this context the word “substantial” means “solid”. Although it is not necessary or advantageous to draw analogies with tests applied in other procedural contexts, the closest analogy is with the test applied in deciding whether a claim should be summarily dismissed, which is whether the claim has a “real prospect of success” [87]–[93]. Because of its (erroneous) conclusion that the judge had not been entitled to reconsider his original decision, the Court of Appeal did not decide certain grounds of appeal raised by the wife. As the Supreme Court has allowed the husband’s appeal, the issues raised by those grounds need to be decided and the case will be remitted to the Court of Appeal for this purpose [98], [107], [108]. Lord Briggs dissents and would dismiss the appeal. In his view, the Supreme Court should leave the “knockout blow” test in place. That test was established by the unanimous, if non-binding, guidance of the Supreme Court, which was subsequently endorsed by the Court of Appeal [112]–[114]. Since then, it has been applied consistently and without criticism or dissent by family law judges [115]–[117], and the rules of court governing applications under Section 13 of the 1984 Act were adopted on the assumption that the “knockout blow” test applied [118]–[124]. Departing from that settled practice would, he considers, undermine both the default rule that Section 13 applications are brought without notice to respondents and judges’ discretion as to whether it is necessary to hear from respondents [125]–[129]. Lord Briggs further recalls that the Supreme Court usually leaves questions of procedure to the Court of Appeal and the appropriate Rules Committee. In his view, the previous approach to Section 13 applications raised no fundamental issue of justice, equity or fairness that would justify the Supreme Court in requiring a change from that practice, on the basis of the exceptional facts of this case. This is because, unlike a typical order made without notice (such as a freezing order), the grant of permission under Section 13 has no immediate effect on the parties’ legal rights, and merely postpones until a later date the occasion when the respondent may advance reasons why permission should not have been given [130]–[143].			
2024	uksc-2021-0147-0150	Lifestyle Equities CV and another (Appellants) v Ahmed and another (Respondents); Lifestyle Equities CV and another (Respondents) v Ahmed and another (Appellants)	Mr Kashif Ahmed and his sister, Ms Bushra Ahmed, were directors of Hornby Street Ltd, a company which arranged for the manufacture of clothing, footwear and headgear and sold it to retailers. During a period of roughly 10 years, Hornby Street sold various items bearing logos with the words ‘SANTA MONICA POLO CLUB’ and pictures of polo players on horses. The Lifestyle companies own trade marks featuring a polo player on a horse and the words ‘BEVERLY HILLS POLO CLUB’. Lifestyle sued Hornby Street alleging that the use of the ‘SANTA MONICA POLO CLUB’ signs infringed Lifestyle’s trade marks. Lifestyle also sued the Ahmeds personally, claiming that they were jointly liable with Hornby Street for the infringements. The trial judge found that the use of the ‘SANTA MONICA POLO CLUB’ signs by Hornby Street infringed Lifestyle’s trade marks, both because the signs were sufficiently similar to Lifestyle’s ‘BEVERLY HILLS POLO CLUB’ signs to give rise to a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public and because such use took unfair advantage of, and was detrimental to, the distinctive character and reputation of Lifestyle’s trade marks. The judge also held that the Ahmeds were jointly liable with Hornby Street on the grounds both that they had procured the infringements of Lifestyle’s trade marks and that the infringements were committed pursuant to a common design. The judge made no findings that the Ahmeds knew or ought to have known that there was a likelihood of confusion or infringement. But, on the judge’s view of the law, the absence of such knowledge did not affect their liability. Hornby Street has since been dissolved. Against the Ahmeds, Lifestyle claimed the remedy of an account of profits. The judge held that the Ahmeds were not liable to account for profits made by Hornby Street from its infringements of Lifestyle’s trade marks but were liable to account for profits which they had themselves made from the infringements. He apportioned 10% of their salaries during the relevant period to such profits and also decided that a loan made by Hornby Street to Mr Ahmed was a profit derived from the infringements. On appeals by both parties, the Court of Appeal upheld this decision, except as regards the loan to Mr Ahmed which, it held, was not a profit. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Lifestyle’s appeal (which argued that the Ahmeds should have been ordered to account for profits made by Hornby Street) and allows the Ahmeds’ appeal. The Ahmeds could not be liable either for procuring the infringements of Lifestyle’s trademarks or on the basis of a common design, when they were not aware of the essential facts which made the use of the ‘SANTA MONICA POLO CLUB’ signs by Hornby Street wrongful. In any case the Ahmeds could not be required to account for profits made by Hornby Street and on the facts found had not themselves made any profits from the infringements. Lord Leggatt gives the judgment, with which the other Justices agree.	Accessory Liability Liability for infringing a trade mark is strict. To establish an infringement, there is no need to prove knowledge or fault - only that the person concerned, without the consent of the owner of the trade mark, used a sign identical with or similar to the trade mark in circumstances which amount to an infringement. Here, however, the Ahmeds did not themselves infringe Lifestyle’s trademarks. The sales of goods bearing the ‘SANTA MONICA POLO CLUB’ signs were made, and the other infringing acts were done, by Hornby Street in the course of its trade [13]–[26]. The case against the Ahmeds is that they are liable as accessories, either because they procured the company to infringe Lifestyle’s trademarks or because they participated in a common design with the company to do so [28]. The key issue is whether, when the wrong is one of strict liability, liability as an accessory is also strict, or whether proof of knowledge or any other mental element is required [29]. The Ahmeds argued that, where directors of a company perform their duties in good faith and with reasonable care, they cannot be held jointly liable with the company for infringements because their acts are treated in law as being the company’s acts [32]. This argument is rejected. It does not follow that, because an act done by a director is treated as the company’s act for which the company can be held liable, the director is immunised from liability. There is no principle of English law which exempts a director, acting in that capacity, from ordinary principles of liability for wrongful acts [33]–[40]. The court nevertheless agrees that it is unjust to hold an individual whose act causes another person to commit a wrong jointly liable for the wrong as an accessory if the individual was acting in good faith and without knowledge of facts which made the act of the other person wrongful [85]. This point is not particular to company directors and does not depend on any special feature of their role, as some cases have incorrectly suggested [64]–[85]. There is no logical requirement that the knowledge or other mental state required for liability as an accessory must be the same as that required for primary liability; so that, if the primary liability is strict, liability as an accessory must also be strict [86]–[89]. That approach would be logical if inducing someone to commit a tort, or participating in a common design to do so, were simply another way of committing a tort. But that is not so. Individuals liable as accessories are liable even though they do not satisfy all the elements of the tort [92]–[95]. In other areas the law requires proof of a particular mental state before holding a person liable as an accessory even though the primary liability is strict. Liability for dishonestly assisting in a breach of trust or for inducing a breach of contract are examples [96]–[101]. Liability for inducing a breach of contract is in fact an instance of a more general principle of the common law that a person who knowingly procures another person to commit an actionable wrong will be jointly liable with that other person for the wrong committed [102]–[110], [135]. The correct approach is that a person who causes another person to do a wrongful act will only be jointly liable as an accessory for the wrong done if they have knowledge of the essential facts which make the act done wrongful [107]–[108]. This is so whether the claim is based on procuring the infringement of a trade mark (or other wrong) or on participation in a common design [111]–[137]. Applying this approach to the facts, as neither Mr nor Ms Ahmed was found to possess knowledge of the essential facts which made the acts of Hornby Street in using the ‘SANTA MONICA POLO CLUB’ signs wrongful, they could not be jointly liable for the company’s infringements [138]–[143]. Account of Profits The remedy of an account of profits is in principle available against anyone who is liable for the infringement of a trade mark or other intellectual property right, even if the infringement is entirely innocent [145]. A central purpose of intellectual property rights is to encourage and reward creativity and innovation by enabling the owner of the right to enjoy the fruits of its exploitation. Ordering a person who makes profits from using a trade mark without the owner’s consent to pay over those profits to the owner of the trade mark promotes that purpose by redirecting the profits to the person entitled to reap the benefits of exploiting the right. Even if the infringement has occurred innocently, the infringer cannot legitimately object to this remedy, as its effect is simply to put the infringer in the same position financially as if the infringement had not taken place. [155]–[157] The courts below were right to reject Lifestyle’s argument that, on the footing that the Ahmeds were jointly liable with Hornby Street for the infringements, they could properly be ordered to account for the profits made by Hornby Street from the infringements. The only profits which a wrongdoer can be required to pay over to the owner of the right infringed are profits which the wrongdoer has made and not profits which someone else has made from the infringing activity. Such an order would amount to a penalty or fine which is not the purpose of the remedy [158]–[169]. The Court of Appeal was right to hold that the loan made by Hornby Street to Mr Ahmed was not a profit. A person does not make a profit just by borrowing money and there was no evidence that the loan was at an artificially low rate of interest or otherwise gave rise to a profit. Nor did the facts that the administrators of Hornby Street had not pursued Mr Ahmed to repay the loan and that the company had since been dissolved alter the character of the transaction [171]–[172]. It was wrong to treat any part of the Ahmeds’ salaries as profits. There was no evidence or finding that their salaries were anything but ordinary remuneration for their services. An employee who receives in return for their services a sum no greater than the fair market value of those services does not make a profit [173]. Therefore, even if the Ahmeds had been liable for the infringements of Lifestyle’s trademarks, they had not made any profits from the infringements. For this reason too, the orders for an account of profits were wrongly made [182].			
2024	uksc-2022-0009	Herculito Maritime Ltd and others (Respondents) v Gunvor International BV and others (Appellants)	By a voyage charterparty dated 20 September 2010 (“the charter”), MT Polar (“the vessel”) was chartered to Clearlake Shipping Ltd (“the charterer”) for a voyage from St Petersburg to Fujairah or, in charterer’s option, Singapore (“the voyage”). The vessel’s master issued six bills of lading (“the bills of lading”) dated between 29 and 30 September 2010 and 2 October 2010 recording shipment of a total cargo of 69,493.28 mts of fuel oil (“the cargo”). On 30 October 2010, the vessel was seized by Somali pirates whilst she was transiting the designated “High Risk Area” in the Gulf of Aden. The vessel was held captive for 10 months before release on 26 August 2011, following the payment of a ransom of USD $7,700,000 by or on behalf of the vessel’s owner (“the shipowner” or Respondent). General average, which requires parties to apportion extraordinary expenses incurred for the preservation of ship and cargo, was declared by the shipowner and in due course a general average adjustment concluded that US$5,914,560 was due to the shipowner from the respective cargo interests (“the cargo interests”). The cargo interests contend that they have no liability in general average in respect of the ransom payment. They submit that, on the true construction of their contract with the shipowner under the bills of lading the shipowner’s only remedy was to recover the ransom payment under the terms of additional insurance cover which had been taken out in relation to such risks pursuant to the terms of the governing voyage charterparty, the premium for which was payable by the charterer. On 8 January 2020, the arbitration tribunal upheld the cargo interests’ case. On appeal, Sir Nigel Teare allowed the shipowner’s appeal. The Court of Appeal upheld Sir Nigel Teare’s decision. The cargo interests now appeal to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal. Lord Hamblen gives the judgment, with which all the other Justices agree.	Four issues arise for decision. Issue (1) - Whether on the proper interpretation of the charter and/or by implication the shipowner was precluded from claiming against the charterer in respect of losses arising out of risks for which additional insurance had been obtained. It is established that contractual parties may agree that specified loss or damage is to be covered by insurance and that in the event of such loss or damage occurring the parties will seek recourse against insurers rather than their contractual counterparty [29]. If so, the parties may have intended to create an ‘insurance fund’ or ‘insurance code’ where recourse to insurers is the sole avenue for making good the relevant loss or damage. In the shipping context, an insurance code or fund has been held to exist under a demise charter and under a time charter. This is the first case in which it has been necessary to consider whether there is an insurance code or fund in a voyage charter, and, if so, bills of lading which incorporated the voyage terms [30]. The charter incorporated the BPVOY 4 form, including clause 39 ‘War Risks’ as amended in the fixture recap (“clause 39”), and various additional clauses, including the ‘War Risk’ clause (“the War Risk clause”) and the ‘Gulf of Aden’ clause (“the Gulf of Aden clause”) (collectively “the War Risk clauses”). The War Risks clauses provided that any additional premia payable in respect of war risks, including piracy, incurred by reason of the vessel trading to excluded areas not covered by the shipowner’s basic war risk insurance were to be for charterer’s account subject to a US$40,000 limit. The direct geographical route for the contractual voyage from St Petersburg to both Fujairah and Singapore was via Suez and the Gulf of Aden. The Gulf of Aden was designated a ‘High Risk Area’ for the purposes of marine insurance. To accommodate this increased risk, before the vessel entered the Gulf of Aden the shipowner took out Kidnap and Ransom insurance and paid an additional premium to extend their annual Hull & Machinery and War Risk insurance. The cargo interests contend that the charterer’s obligation to pay additional war risk premia for transit through the Gulf of Aden means that the parties agreed to look to insurers rather than to each other in the event of loss or damage covered by the insurance. Cargo interests rely on the decision in Kodros Shipping Corp of Monrovia v Empresa Cubana de Fletes (The Evia (No 2)) [1983] 1 AC 736 in which an insurance code was held to have been agreed in a time charterparty [59]. A critical question is whether the charter is materially different or distinguishable from the time charter in that case [58]. For the detailed reasons given in the judgment, the terms of the charter are materially different to those of the charter in The Evia (No 2) which decision can and should be distinguished [61-73]. Given the carefully agreed contractual regime for the known piracy risks of transiting the Gulf of Aden it would not have been open to the shipowner to contend that such risks were “war risks” for the purposes of clause 39. In those circumstances, this is not a case in which the charterer would otherwise obtain no benefit from the payment of the additional premia. Nor is it one in which it was undertaking a significant additional burden [72]. The terms of the charter are therefore materially different to those of the charter in The Evia (No 2) [73]. Further, tribunals should be cautious before following the reasoning in that decision in relation to differently termed charters [74] because: (1) English commercial law recognises the importance of certainty and fosters it so far as possible; (2) the search for an insurance code introduces uncertainty; (3) if parties wish to provide that there can be no right of recovery or subrogation, in respect of loss or damage, they can easily do so expressly; and, (4) there are various practical difficulties which may arise [74]. There was therefore no insurance code or fund agreed in the charter [75]. The further issues which arise are addressed on the assumption that there was such a code and concern whether such a code was incorporated into the bills of lading. Issue (2) - whether all material parts of those clauses were incorporated into the bills of lading The shipowner contends that those parts of the War Risks clauses which concern the obligations for payment of insurance premia are not directly relevant to the loading, carriage, and discharge of the cargo, or the payment of freight, and therefore are not incorporated into the bills of lading [88]. In the judgment the leading cases on the incorporation of charter terms into bills of lading are considered and the relevant principles summarised [77-87]. Applying those principles, the Court agrees with the judge and Court of Appeal that this argument should be rejected on the grounds that the clauses relate to the route to be taken by the vessel and therefore are directly relevant to the carriage. There is a prima facie incorporation of clause 39 of the charter and the liberties given to the shipowner thereunder [89]. These provide an important protection to the shipowner in relation to voyage war risks and are relevant to carriage. That being the case, it is equally important that charter provisions which limit or qualify the wide liberties given under clause 39, namely the Gulf of Aden clause and War Risks clause, are also incorporated. Therefore, all material parts of those clauses were incorporated into the bills of lading. Issue (3) - Whether on the proper interpretation of those clauses in the bill of lading and/or by implication the shipowner was similarly precluded from claiming for its losses against the bill of lading holders Once clauses of the charter are incorporated into the bills of lading, they are treated as being fully set out in the bill of lading contract. The clauses then must be interpreted in the context of that contract, and for the purposes of issue (3), it is assumed that this involves no manipulation of the wording [91-92]. The cargo interests argue that the charterer should be regarded as paying the additional insurance premia on behalf of cargo interests as it is they rather than the charterer who would be most directly concerned in the event of kidnap and ransom and they who would bear the principal liability to contribute in general average [94]. There is, however, no term of the charter which supports this analysis [96]. The obligation is that of the charterer and it has its own interest in ensuring proper performance of the charter. Moreover, there is no insurance code or fund case which extends any understanding to that effect beyond the parties to the relevant contract. Therefore on the proper interpretation of those clauses in the bill of lading the shipowner was not precluded from claiming for such losses against the bill of lading holders [99]. Issue (4) - If necessary, whether the wording of those clauses should be manipulated so as to substitute the words “the Charterers” with “the holders of the bill of lading” in the parts of those clauses allocating responsibility for the payment of the additional insurance premia. Manipulation of charter clauses incorporated by general words of incorporation may be permissible if it is necessary to do so to make the wording fit the bill of lading. There is no such need in this case because the allocation of responsibility for paying additional premia makes sense in the context of the bills of lading as a record of the terms upon which the shipowner has agreed to transit the Gulf of Aden [97]. Further, as held by both the judge and the Court of Appeal, there are positive reasons why there should be no manipulation such as the implausibility of bill of lading holders accepting a potential liability to pay unknown and unpredictable amounts [98].			
2024	uksc-2022-0019	Jersey Choice Ltd (Appellant) v His Majesty’s Treasury (Respondent)	This appeal concerns liability to pay Value Added Tax (“VAT) on low value goods which were sold and despatched by mail order from the Channel Islands to customers in UK, at the time when the UK was a member of the European Union (“EU”). The appellant, Jersey Choice Ltd (“JCL”), is a Jersey-registered company that grows horticultural products in Jersey, which it mainly exports by way of mail order directly to consumers in the UK in small packets. The value of the contents of these packets was so low at the relevant time as to attract the then applicable low value consignment relief (“LVC Relief”). LVC Relief operated to exempt goods valued below £15 from import VAT. In 2012, the UK passed legislation which removed LVC Relief on mail order imports into the UK from the Channel Islands. This was intended to combat a practice known as “round-tripping”, which involved the export of goods from the UK to the Channel Islands in order to then re-import the goods into the UK VAT free. JCL brought proceedings against the respondent, His Majesty’s Treasury, which is responsible for UK taxation policy. It claimed that the withdrawal of the LVC Relief constituted a serious breach of EU law which was contrary to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) and general principles of EU law, including principles of equal treatment and proportionality. JCL claims for loss and damage it says it suffered as a result of the breach. The High Court struck out JCL’s claim on the basis that it had shown no reasonable grounds for the claim. That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. JCL now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses JCL’s appeal. It finds that JCL’s case disclosed no reasonable grounds for the claim. Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lady Rose give the judgment, with which all the other Justices agree.	The legislative provisions The relationship between the EU and the Channel Islands was governed by Article 355 TFEU and the 1972 Treaty of Accession of the United Kingdom. Whilst the UK was a member of the EU, EU rules relating to the common customs area and the internal free market for goods applied in full to the Channel Islands. The EU rules on VAT did not apply to the Channel Islands [7], [10]. The EU legislation which governed the application of VAT was the Principal VAT Directive (2006/112/EC) (“the VAT Directive”). Article 6(1) of the VAT Directive specified territories forming part of the EU customs territory to which the Directive did not apply (“article 6(1) territories”) [11]. Imports from article 6(1) territories were treated as VAT imports even if the goods were already in free circulation within the EU customs area. The Channel Islands were article 6(1) territories. The VAT Directive granted Member States the power to exclude mail order imports from LVC Relief [12]. The appeal was argued on the basis that, as the proceedings were commenced before the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, JCL was entitled to pursue its damages claim [26]. Should the legality of the removal of the LVC Relief be assessed under the EU fiscal regime or the customs regime? JCL’s primary argument is that the reimposition of VAT as a result of the withdrawal of the LVC Relief amounted to a charge having equivalent effect to a customs duty contrary to the TFEU provisions regarding free movement of goods [30]. The EU customs and fiscal regime are mutually exclusive; the removal of LVC Relief can only fall within one of them [33]. For a measure to be characterised as equivalent to a customs duty it must satisfy two tests. [39]. First, it must be shown that the charge affects only imported products, as opposed to internal taxation which affects imported products and domestic products alike [30]. Second, the measure must not be part of a general system of internal dues applicable systematically to categories of products according to objective criteria applied without regard to the origin of the products. In the present case, the charge to VAT on imports from the Channel Islands fails both tests [40]. As regards the first test, the mere fact that a charge is made because goods cross a border cannot of itself make it equivalent to a customs duty. Otherwise, all charges to VAT on importation would be equivalent to a customs duty. The charge arises because importation counts as a relevant transaction for the purposes of the VAT system; corresponding products supplied within the UK are subject to VAT in the same way. The charge also fails the second test, as it is properly characterised as internal taxation [41]. EU law did not prohibit a selective disapplication of LVC Relief as between territories outside the VAT Directive area. Even if did, the resulting unlawful VAT charge would still fall to be assessed under the fiscal regime and not the customs regime [44]-[45]. Can JCL rely on EU law general principles? JCL argues that the UK breached general principles of EU law by removing the LVC Relief from the Channel Islands but leaving it in place for imports from other article 6(1) territories. The general principle of equal treatment applies in the field of taxation [58]. That principle has no application to imports from third countries [60]. The key question is whether Jersey should be treated as a third country or as a Member State in the context of the VAT Directive. The Court holds that Jersey was a third country for the purposes of the VAT Directive [68]. The Directive made clear that imports from the Channel Islands were to be treated as being from a third territory, notwithstanding that the Channel Islands formed part of the customs territory. This reflects the selective application of EU law to Jersey, as agreed in the Treaty of Accession and article 355 TFEU. Similarly, the principle of proportionality has no application in respect of the VAT treatment of third territories which are outside of the VAT Directive area [77]. Failure to protect fundamental rights under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TEU”), the Charter of Fundamental Rights (“CFR”) and the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) JCL argues that the Court of Appeal failed to provide effective legal protection for its EU law rights under the TEU and CFR. The Court finds that the right to a remedy under the TEU and CFR only arises where there has been a breach of rights; it cannot of itself generate a right under EU law or a breach of right [83]. JCL’s claim to damages is therefore not a “possession” protected by Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the ECHR.			
2024	uksc-2022-0038-0044-0049	Paul and another (Appellants) v Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust (Respondent); Polmear and another (Appellants) v Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust (Respondent); Purchase (Appellant) v Ahmed (Respondent)	The claimants in these three cases are each claiming compensation in the tort of negligence for psychiatric illness caused by the experience of witnessing the death of a close family member in distressing circumstances. In each case, the death was allegedly caused by the negligence of the defendant doctor or health authority in failing to diagnose and treat a life-threatening medical condition. In Paul, the claimants are two young daughters who were present when their father died suddenly from such a condition in a public street. In Polmear, the claimants are parents who witnessed the tragic death of their young daughter. In Purchase, the claimant came upon her daughter in shocking circumstances a few minutes after her death. In each case, the defendant applied to have the claim for compensation for psychiatric illness summarily dismissed, arguing that, assuming all the facts alleged are true, as a matter of law the claim cannot succeed. By different routes, this issue in each case reached the Court of Appeal, which heard the appeals together. The Court of Appeal dismissed all three claims. The claimants now appeal to the Supreme Court.	By a majority of six to one, the Supreme Court dismisses the appeals. The court concludes that, while doctors owe a duty of care to protect the health of their patients, they do not owe a duty of care to members of the patient’s close family to protect them against the risk of illness from the experience of witnessing the death or medical crisis of their relative from a condition which the doctor has negligently failed to diagnose or treat. The Court of Appeal’s order dismissing the claims is, therefore, upheld. Lord Leggatt and Lady Rose, with whom Lord Briggs, Lord Sales and Lord Richards agree, give the leading judgment. Lord Carloway, with whom Lord Sales agrees, gives a judgment concurring with Lord Leggatt and Lady Rose. Lord Burrows gives a dissenting judgment.	For centuries, under the common law, the general rule has been that a person cannot claim compensation for the effect on them, however severe, of the death or injury of another person [2]. An exception has developed which allows a person to claim compensation for personal injury (typically, psychiatric illness) caused by witnessing an accident (or the immediate aftermath of an accident) brought about by the defendant’s negligence, in which a close family member (or other loved one) is killed or injured (or put in peril of death or injury) [26]–[51]. An “accident” in this context refers to an unexpected and unintended event in which injury (or the risk of injury) is caused by violent external means: for example, a road accident [23]–[24]. The claimants have argued that this exceptional category of case includes—or should by analogy be extended to include—cases where, as a result of a doctor’s negligence, a person dies or manifests injury from a disease which proper treatment would have prevented [24], [50]. The question has not previously been authoritatively decided or examined in any depth [59]. The case law does not provide any conclusive answer. However, the Supreme Court rejects this argument. In the view of the majority, no analogy can reasonably be drawn between cases involving accidents and cases where the claimant does not witness an accident but suffers illness as a result of witnessing a death or medical crisis brought about by an untreated disease [140]–[143]. Accidents are discrete events. It is usually clear and easy to determine whether someone was present at the scene of and directly perceived an accident. Witnessing an accident involving a close family member is likely to be a disturbing and upsetting event. A person who suffers psychiatric injury when their own life or safety is put at risk by a defendant’s negligent conduct is entitled to claim compensation and it would be difficult and arbitrary to distinguish between psychiatric injury caused by fear for the claimant’s own safety and by fear for the safety of a close family member [107]–[110]. By contrast, in the medical context there is often no event comparable to an accident, as the symptoms of disease or injury may develop over days, months or years. How traumatic it is to witness such events is also highly variable. [111]–[116]. The majority judgment considers and rejects as unacceptable various suggested tests for limiting claims to cases where the close family member suffers a ‘sudden shock’, or where the event witnessed is sufficiently ‘horrifying’, or where the event witnessed is the ‘first manifestation’ of the medical condition [71]–[82], [97]–[103]. Further, in cases where there is no accident, there is no possibility of psychiatric injury caused by fear for the claimant’s own safety or bodily integrity [114]. It is also necessary to consider the nature of a doctor’s role and the purposes for which medical care is provided to a patient. The responsibilities of a doctor, and the purposes for which care is provided, do not extend to protecting members of the patient’s close family from exposure to the traumatic experience of witnessing the death or manifestation of disease or injury in their relative. In the court’s view, in the current state of society the point has not been reached where the experience of witnessing the death of a close family member from disease is something from which a person can reasonably expect to be shielded by the medical profession [124]–[139]. Consequently, notwithstanding grave sympathy for the claimants, the claims must be dismissed [140]–[143]. Lord Carloway gives a concurring judgment, explaining that, despite historical differences in its development, the same result would be reached under Scots law [252]–[256]. Lord Burrows dissents. He would allow the appeals and hold that the claims can proceed [244], [251]. The majority’s approach will preclude claims by the loved ones of patients, like the claimants, in virtually all circumstances of medical negligence and, in Lord Burrows’ opinion, that is unwarranted [250]. The relevant event should be viewed as the death of the primary victim and, applying the existing proximity or control factors established in the leading cases on claims by secondary victims for negligently caused psychiatric illness, it follows that the relevant duty of care was owed to the relatives in all three cases [198]–[199]. On that approach, there is no need for an accident, that is an event external to the primary victim, which will rarely arise in the medical negligence context [205]–[211]. Even if allowing the appeals were to represent an incremental step forward, that would represent a justified and principled development of the law [201]–[204].			
2024	uksc-2022-0064	R (on the application of Finch on behalf of the Weald Action Group) (Appellant) v Surrey County Council and others (Respondents)	Before planning permission can be granted for a development project which is likely to have significant effects on the environment, legislation in the United Kingdom (and many other countries) requires an environmental impact assessment (“EIA”) to be carried out. The legislation applicable in this case is contained in the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (the ‘2017 Regulations’), which implemented European Union Directive 92/11/EU (the ‘EIA Directive’) in the UK. This requires an EIA to identify, describe and assess the likely “direct and indirect significant effects” of the project on the environment, including (among other factors) the impact on climate (for example, the nature and magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions). The process of assessment must include public consultation. The legislation does not prevent the planning authority from giving consent for a project that is likely to cause significant harm to the environment; but it requires the authority to reach a reasoned conclusion on the environmental impact and to take this conclusion into account in making its decision. In this case a developer applied to Surrey County Council for planning permission to expand oil production from a well site at Horse Hill near Horley in Surrey. The proposed project would involve the extraction of oil from six wells over a period of 20 years. The project comes within a category for which an EIA is compulsory (“Extraction of petroleum … for commercial purposes where the amount extracted exceeds 500 tonnes/day”). The developer argued that, as regards the impact of the project on climate, the scope of the EIA should be confined to the direct releases of greenhouse gases from within the well site boundary during the lifetime of the project; and that the EIA need not include an assessment of the greenhouse gas emissions that would occur when the oil extracted from the wells was ultimately burnt elsewhere as fuel. The council accepted this approach. Its decision to grant 2 planning permission for the project was therefore made without assessing or taking into account the emissions that will occur upon combustion of the oil produced. The claimant, a local resident, applied for judicial review of the council’s decision. She argued that the decision was unlawful because the EIA was required to, but did not, include an assessment of the combustion emissions. The High Court rejected the claim, holding that the combustion emissions were not within the legal scope of the EIA Directive and 2017 Regulations; alternatively, whether to assess them was a matter of evaluative judgment for the council, which had given legally valid reasons for deciding not to do so. By a majority, the Court of Appeal upheld the judge’s decision on the second of those grounds. The claimant appealed to the Supreme Court.	By a three-to-two majority, the Supreme Court allows the appeal and holds that the council’s decision was unlawful because the emissions that will occur when the oil produced is burnt as fuel are within the scope of the EIA required by law. Lord Leggatt, with whom Lord Kitchin and Lady Rose agree, gives the majority judgment. Lord Sales, with whom Lord Richards agrees, dissents.	It is an agreed fact that, if the project goes ahead, it is not merely likely but inevitable that the oil produced from the well site will be refined and, as an end product, will eventually undergo combustion, and that that combustion will produce greenhouse gas emissions [45]. It is not disputed that these emissions will have a significant impact on climate. It is agreed that the amount of these emissions can be estimated using an established methodology; indeed, the council has provided such an estimate as part of its evidence in this case [81]. The issue is whether the combustion emissions constitute “direct or indirect … effects of the project” within the meaning of the EIA Directive and 2017 Regulations. If they are, they must be assessed as part of the EIA. The Supreme Court is unanimous in rejecting the view of the Court of Appeal that this question requires an evaluative judgment about whether there is a sufficient causal connection between the extraction of the oil and its eventual combustion, on which different planning authorities could reasonably take opposite views. It is unreasonable to interpret the EIA Directive in a way that treats inconsistent answers to the question whether the combustion emissions are “effects of the project” as equally valid [59]–[60], [321]–[325]. The majority of the Court considers this question to be one of causation to which, on the agreed facts, only one answer can reasonably be given. The emissions that will occur on combustion of the oil produced are “effects of the project” because it is known with certainty that, if the project goes ahead, all the oil extracted from the ground will inevitably be burnt thereby releasing greenhouse gases into the earth’s atmosphere in a quantity which can readily be estimated [79]–[81]. The EIA Directive does not impose any geographical limit on the scope of the environmental effects of a project that must be assessed. The council was therefore wrong to confine the EIA in this case to emissions expected to occur at the project site. It is in the very nature of “indirect” effects that they may occur away from their source [101]–[103]. Moreover, the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate does not depend on where the release occurs [97]. 3 The judge considered that the emissions occurring on combustion cannot in law be regarded as effects of the project because what is burnt as fuel will not be the crude oil produced from the well site but an end product made at a separate facility where the oil will be refined. The Supreme Court rejects this argument. The process of refining crude oil does not alter its basic nature or intended use and cannot reasonably be regarded as breaking the causal connection between the extraction of the oil and its subsequent combustion. The judge was concerned about the implications of this conclusion for other projects: for example, a project to produce steel which is then used to manufacture parts for use in making motor vehicles or aircraft. If the greenhouse gas emissions that will result from the use of the motor vehicles or aircraft were regarded as indirect effects of the production of the steel, the EIA process would be unduly onerous and unworkable. The Court considers these concerns to be misplaced. Raw materials such as steel can be put to many possible uses, and the view might reasonably be taken that no meaningful assessment or estimate can be made of what emissions will ultimately result from its use. Oil is a very different commodity. There is no element of conjecture about what will ultimately happen to the oil; refining the oil does not change it into a different type of object (unlike the incorporation of a part in a motor vehicle or aircraft); and a reasonable estimate can readily be made of the emissions that will occur upon its inevitable combustion [112]–[139]. An argument that national planning policy is relevant to the scope of the EIA required by the EIA Directive is also rejected. The UK’s national policy of encouraging domestic production of oil and gas is relevant to the decision of the planning authority whether to grant permission for the project. But it does not dispense with the requirement to assess the environmental impact of the project or justify limiting the scope of that assessment before the planning decision is taken. The purpose of the EIA is to ensure that, whatever the decision taken, it is taken with full knowledge and public awareness of the likely significant environmental consequences [140]–[154]. Consequently, the council’s failure to assess the effect on climate of the combustion of the oil that would be produced from the proposed well site means that its decision to grant planning permission for the project was unlawful [174]. Lord Sales, dissenting, observes that the EIA Directive contemplates that decisions on the grant of planning consent will often be taken by local or regional authorities [252]. Downstream emissions are addressed by central governments at the level of national policy [253]. In his view, it would be constitutionally inappropriate for a local planning authority to assume practical decision-making authority based on its own views regarding downstream emissions [256] and it would also be contrary to the EU principle of proportionality [260]. The general scheme of the EIA Directive further indicates that the entirety of downstream emissions do not qualify as indirect effects of a project [261]. This is also clear from its text [273]. The formula used in the EIA Directive indicates that even indirect effects still have to be effects ‘of the project’ which on a natural reading does not include downstream emissions [276]. Lord Sales therefore agrees with the approach of the High Court in which the question is to be determined by a proper interpretation of the EIA Directive as a matter of law [327].			
2024	uksc-2022-0078	In the matter of an application by Stephen Hilland for Judicial Review (Appellant) (Northern Ireland)	This appeal concerns the practice adopted by the Offender Recall Unit (“the ORU”) of the Department of Justice relating to the revocation of a prisoner’s licence and their recall to prison. The appellant had been sentenced to two consecutive 12-month determinate custodial sentences (each a “DCS”). Shortly after his automatic release on licence the appellant was arrested and, following the recommendation of a Parole Commissioner, the Department of Justice revoked the appellant’s licence and recalled him to prison. The different categories of sentences and their corresponding licencing and recall regimes are established by the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (“the 2008 Order”). The appellant brought judicial review proceedings in the High Court challenging the decision to revoke his licence and recall him to prison. He argued that there was unjustifiable discrimination between DCS prisoners on the one hand and two other categories of prisoners – those serving indeterminate custodial sentences (“ICS”) and those serving extended custodial sentences (“ECS”) – on the other, because a significant element of the ORU’s practice (as informed by the Parole Commissioner’s guidance and the recall provisions set out in section 28 of the 2008 Order) is to recall DCS prisoners if considered necessary for the protection of the public from harm whereas the practice in respect of ICS and ECS prisoners is to recall if considered necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm. He argued that this constituted a breach of article 14 (concerning discrimination) of the European Convention on Human Rights (the “Convention”), taken together with article 5 (concerning the right to liberty). The High Court dismissed the claim on the basis that DCS prisoners on the one hand and ICS and ECS prisoners on the other are not in an analogous (i.e. comparable) situation (a necessary element of any article 14 claim) and in any event any difference in treatment was objectively justified. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant’s appeal.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. It holds that the ORU’s practice in relation to revocation and recall does not breach article 14 of the Convention. Lord Stephens gives the leading judgment, with which Lord Lloyd-Jones, Lord Briggs, Lord Sales and Lord Burrows agree.	For the appellant to succeed in arguing that the practice relating to recall and revocation unjustifiably discriminates against him, he would need to establish the four elements identified by Lady Black in R (Stott) v Secretary of State for Justice [2018] UKSC 59, [2020] AC 51 [11]. The appellant satisfied the first and second of those elements: first, that the circumstances must fall within the ambit of a Convention right and second, that the difference in treatment was on the basis of one of the recognised characteristics required to bring an article 14 claim. This appeal was concerned with the third and fourth elements of that test: that the claimant and the person who has been treated differently are in analogous situations (the third element) and that there is no objective justification for the different treatment (the fourth element). The appellant argued that the lower courts in this case were wrong not to address the fourth element before the third element. The Supreme Court held that although some cases suggested that it may be best to look at justification before addressing analogous situations, it remains a matter for the court’s discretion to decide which of those elements to look at first [111]-[115]. This ground of appeal was therefore dismissed. The Supreme Court held that in considering whether the other prisoners are in an analogous situation to DCS prisoners, the sentencing regimes must be viewed as whole entities, each with its own particular, different, mix of ingredients, designed for a particular set of circumstances [137]. Based on a review of the statutory provisions concerning DCS, ICS, ECS, mandatory and discretionary life sentences [59-108], the Supreme Court concluded that each sentence has its own detailed set of rules, dictating when it can be imposed and how it operates in practice, the revocation of the prisoner’s licence and recall to prison being part and parcel of the rules [137]. Accordingly, the Supreme Court concluded that the regimes applying to DCS prisoners are not analogous to the regimes applying to ECS and ICS prisoners and it dismissed this ground of appeal. The difference in relation to revocation and recall simply represents another facet of the overall different regimes [140]. On the appellant’s proposed approach of recalling only where there is a risk of serious harm, DCS prisoners would ordinarily never be recalled because they tend not to present a risk of serious harm [140]. In relation to the fourth element, the Supreme Court observed that objective justification is to be judged in the wider context of considering each of the sentencing regimes holistically [142]. The aim being pursued by the different sentencing regimes is to cater for different combinations of offending and risk in appropriate ways. The Supreme Court found that this is a legitimate aim and that the means are proportionate because: (1) the revocation and recall practice reflects the characteristic of a DCS prisoner as ordinarily not presenting a risk of serious harm [145]; (2) the overall arrangements in respect of the different prisoners correspond to the scale of seriousness of each sentence [146]; and (3) the ORU and the Parole Commissioners are well within the discretion afforded to them to strike a balance between the interests of public protection and the interests of the individual prisoner [147]. Accordingly, this ground of appeal was dismissed.			
2024	uksc-2022-0080	Secretary of State for Business and Trade (Respondent) v Mercer (Appellant)	The appellant, Ms Mercer, was employed as a support worker in the care sector by a care services provider, Alternative Futures Group Ltd (“AFG”). As a workplace representative of UNISON, she was involved in planning and took part in lawful strike action. She was subsequently suspended by AFG. While suspended, Ms Mercer received normal pay but was unable to earn pay for the overtime she would otherwise have worked. Ms Mercer brought a claim against AFG under section 146 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (“TULRCA”) that she had suffered detrimental treatment done for the sole or main purpose of preventing or deterring her from taking part in the activities of an independent trade union "at an appropriate time” or penalising her for having done so. By agreement between the parties, the Employment Tribunal determined as a preliminary issue whether, in light of articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”), section 146 of TULRCA protected workers from detriment short of dismissal for participation in lawful industrial action as a member of an independent trade union. The Employment Tribunal held that it did not. However, the Employment Appeal Tribunal allowed Ms Mercer’s appeal and held that it could be interpreted as doing so. The Court of Appeal allowed a further appeal by the intervener, the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, holding that section 146 could not be interpreted compatibly with article 10 of the Convention but refused to make a declaration of incompatibility. Ms Mercer now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal to the extent that it makes a declaration that section 146 TULRCA is incompatible with article 11 ECHR. Lady Simler gives the only judgment, with which the other justices agree.	Employees who are dismissed for taking part in lawful strike action have some statutory remedies for unfair dismissal; however, there is no express statutory (or other) protection in domestic law against action taken by an employer short of dismissal for participation in lawful strike action. The question in this appeal is whether section 146 can be interpreted to provide such protection, and if not, what is the consequence [1]. Construction of section 146 and compliance with Article 11 Section 146 of TULRCA protects a worker against detrimental treatment by their employer done with the sole or main purpose of preventing or deterring them from taking part in the activities of an independent trade union “at an appropriate time”. However, as a matter of domestic interpretation, section 146 does not provide protection from detriment short of dismissal to workers participating in lawful strike action. This is because the words “at an appropriate time” are defined to exclude working time (except with the employer’s consent). Protection is therefore limited to activities which are outside working hours and/or done at a time that is not inconsistent with the worker’s job responsibilities. Industrial action will normally be carried out during working hours if it is to have the desired effect, since for workers to withhold their labour at a time when the employer has no expectation of labour being provided is unlikely to have any consequence for the employer. This interpretation is reinforced by other provisions of TULRCA. For example, an employee (though not the wider category of “worker”) may benefit from protection against dismissal for participating in trade union activities at an appropriate time by section 152 of TULRCA, which is in similar terms to section 146. By contrast, employees who participate in lawful industrial action have limited protection against dismissal under sections 237 to 238A of TULRCA. An employee cannot fall within both schemes at the same time. To interpret section 152 as including protection for participation in lawful industrial action in working hours would mean that an employee dismissed for engaging in such industrial action at an appropriate time could bring a claim for unfair dismissal under section 152, thus avoiding and making redundant the carefully constructed regime giving more limited protection for dismissal in sections 237 to 238A of TULRCA. Sections 146 and 152 are sibling provisions and should be interpreted consistently with each other. It therefore follows that section 146 does not provide protection against detriment short of dismissal for taking part in or organising industrial action [3], [8], [44]-[48]. The Supreme Court had therefore to consider whether the absence of any protection in TULRCA for workers taking part in lawful industrial action against detriments short of dismissal is compatible with article 11 of the Convention [60]. The cases decided by the European Court of Human Rights (“the ECHR”) demonstrate that, although the right to strike is protected by article 11, it is not a core right, nor is it absolute. This case concerns the UK’s positive obligations to protect the right to strike as regulator of relationships between private employers and workers. In such cases, the ECHR has afforded states a wider margin of appreciation because of the sensitive social and political issues engaged. The UK is not required to provide universal protection in all circumstances to all workers against any detriment (however slight) intended to dissuade or penalise them from participating in a lawful strike. However, it is not the case that the UK has no positive obligations at all. The legislative scheme must strike a fair balance between the competing interests of employers and workers, and any restriction to the protection of article 11 rights must be justified, recognising the margin of appreciation to be accorded to the state [81]-[83]. In the UK, domestic law does not provide any protection for a worker faced with a disciplinary sanction short of dismissal for taking part in a lawful strike. The right of an employer to impose any sanction it chooses, short of dismissal, for participation in lawful strike action nullifies the right to strike, as employees are unable to strike without exposing themselves to detrimental treatment. In that sense, section 146 both encourages and legitimises unfair and unreasonable conduct by employers. Had there been legislation addressing detrimental treatment short of dismissal for lawful strike action, it might be possible to say that a fair balance had been struck. However, no protection is provided and this places the UK in breach of its obligations under article 11 [85]-[90]. Section 3 of the HRA The Supreme Court had therefore to consider whether it is possible to interpret section 146 in a way that is compatible with article 11 of the Convention within the meaning of section 3 of the HRA. Section 3 of the HRA requires the courts to interpret primary legislation compatibly with the Convention unless the legislation itself makes it impossible to do so. However, it does not enable the court to change the substance of a provision from one where it says one thing into one that says the opposite. In this case, there is no reading of section 146 that would avoid having to make a series of policy choices with potentially far reaching practical ramifications. This would amount to impermissible judicial legislation rather than interpretation. Further, to interpret the legislation as proposed by Ms Mercer would contradict a fundamental feature of the legislative scheme in TULRCA. Therefore, in this case, section 146 cannot be interpreted as providing the protection sought [92], [94], [102]-[108]. Section 4 of the HRA The Supreme Court had therefore to consider whether to make a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the HRA. A declaration of incompatibility does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the relevant provision. The Court of Appeal held that it could not make a declaration because the incompatibility arose from a gap in domestic law, rather than from a specific provision in primary legislation. The Supreme Court disagrees. Section 146 is the only route that could be available to the appellant to vindicate her article 11 right in the domestic courts or tribunals. But this route is blocked by the conventional interpretation given to section 146 of TULRCA. That is what is inherently objectionable in the terms of section 146 of TULRCA as it stands and means that section 146 is incompatible with article 11 of the Convention [116]-[117]. The court has discretion as to whether to make a declaration of incompatibility. There may be cases where it is not appropriate to make a declaration. However, this is not such a case. Such policy choices as may be required in determining how to strike a fair balance between the competing interests at stake are matters for Parliament to address, and it is for Parliament to choose whether to legislate in this area, and if so, how. But this is not a basis for refusing to make a declaration in this case [118]-[120]. The court therefore makes a declaration under section 4 of the HRA that section 146 of TULRCA is incompatible with article 11, insofar as it fails to provide any protection against sanctions short of dismissal, intended to deter or penalise trade union members from taking part in lawful strike action organised by their trade union [121].			
2024	uksc-2022-0100	Armstead (Appellant) v Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Company Ltd (Respondent)	This case concerns a road traffic accident in which a car was damaged. Although the sum at stake is only £1,560, the decision has the potential to affect a significant number of other cases. It also raises some fundamental questions in applying the tort of negligence (a form of civil wrong). The appellant, Lorna Armstead, was unlucky enough to be involved in two road traffic collisions within a short space of time, neither of which was her fault. After the first collision, while her car was being repaired, she hired a car, a Mini Cooper, from a company called Helphire Limited on credit hire terms. The business model of credit hire companies is that they rent out a substitute car on credit to an accident victim believed not to have been at fault while the victim’s car is repaired. The hire company seeks to recover the hire cost on behalf of the victim from the other driver’s insurers and only looks to the victim for payment if the claim fails. In the normal course of events, this enables the accident victim to have the use of a hire car for which she does not have to pay. The hire agreement between Helphire and Ms Armstead was on Helphire’s standard terms, which included an obligation on the hirer to return the car in the same condition as it was at the start of the hire and to pay Helphire for any damage to the car. Most significantly for the purposes of this appeal, there was a term in the agreement, clause 16, under which, if the hire car was damaged, the hirer was required to pay the daily hire rate, up to a maximum of 30 days, for Helphire’s loss of use while the car was being repaired, or awaiting repair, and was therefore out of use. While she was driving the hire car, Ms Armstead was involved in the second accident when she was hit by a van that was being negligently driven. She brought a claim against the van driver’s insurers (Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Company Ltd, “RSA”). She sought damages for the cost of repair of the Mini but also for the sum under clause 16 (“the clause 16 sum”) that she was contractually liable to pay Helphire for its loss of use. The issue on the appeal is whether she is entitled to damages for the clause 16 sum (which is agreed to be £1,560). Ms Armstead’s claim to the clause 16 sum was rejected by a Deputy District Judge, a Recorder and the Court of Appeal. Ms Armstead now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Ms Armstead is held entitled to damages for the clause 16 sum. This is essentially because a claimant in the tort of negligence can recover, as damages, the amount of a contractual liability that the claimant owes to a third party, when that contractual liability is incurred as a result of the defendant’s wrongful act in negligently damaging the claimant’s property. Such a loss is not what the law terms “pure economic loss” which is normally irrecoverable in the tort of negligence. Furthermore, on these facts, the clause 16 sum was not too remote. Lord Leggatt and Lord Burrows give the lead judgment, with which Lord Richards and Lady Simler agree. Lord Briggs gives a brief concurring judgment.	It is well-established that, in tort, a person owes a duty of care not to cause physical damage to another person’s property (such as a car) and, if in breach of that duty, is liable to pay damages to compensate the injured person for the reduced value of the property and any financial loss consequent on the damage [19]–[20]. A person may bring a claim against the wrongdoer in respect of the damage if they are entitled to possession of the property damaged [21]. Ms Armstead, as the hirer of the car, was entitled to possession of it when it was damaged. Therefore, Ms Armstead was entitled to recover the clause 16 sum unless excluded or reduced by the general principles limiting the recovery of damages [22]–[23]. Such loss was not “pure economic loss” because it arose from damage to property that was in Ms Armstead’s possession [27], [44]. Previous cases established that, in principle, a contractual liability owed to a third party could be recovered as damages, provided that it was consequential on physical damage to the claimant’s property [31]–[36]. The Court of Appeal sought to distinguish these cases on various bases, each of which is rejected by the Supreme Court [38]–[41]. The real issue was whether the Court of Appeal was entitled to conclude that the clause 16 sum was too remote to be recovered because it was not a reasonable estimate of Helphire’s loss of use—i.e., the likely losses that Helphire might incur if, due to repairs, the hired car was unavailable for hiring out [45]. Ms Armstead had conceded before the Court of Appeal, and reaffirmed in the Supreme Court, that, to be recoverable, the clause 16 sum needed to be a genuine and reasonable pre-estimate of Helphire’s loss of use [46]. Although not bound by this concession, the majority considers that it was correctly made. If the contractual liability to Helphire did not represent a reasonable pre-estimate of Helphire’s loss of use, it would be too remote to be recoverable because it would not be the type of loss that could be reasonably foreseen [47], [52]. The same result is reached by analysing the contractual liability as either an unenforceable penalty or an unfair term that is not binding on a consumer under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 [48]–[51]. The Supreme Court decides that, where the question is whether loss is too remote from a tort, as in this case, the burden of proof in respect of remoteness is on the defendant. [58]–[64]. In this case, RSA pleaded no case and led no evidence to prove that the clause 16 sum was not a reasonable pre-estimate of Helphire’s loss of use [65], [71]. The Court of Appeal was, therefore, wrong to make the factual assumption, unsupported by any evidence, that the clause 16 sum was not a reasonable pre-estimate of Helphire’s loss of use [67]–[69]. Indeed, on its face, using the contractual rate payable under Ms Armstead’s hire agreement (capped at 30 days’ hire) to calculate the sum was a reasonable way to pre-estimate Helphire’s likely loss of use [70]. Accordingly, as RSA had not discharged its burden of showing that the clause 16 sum was too remote to be recoverable, Ms Armstead was entitled to recover, as damages, that sum (of £1,560). The Supreme Court, therefore, allows her appeal [74]. Lord Briggs gives a concurring judgment. He agrees with the majority’s reasoning and conclusion but would simply rely on Ms Armstead’s concession that the clause 16 sum needed to be a genuine and reasonable pre-estimate of Helphire’s likely losses without deciding whether the concession was correctly made [75]–[79].			
2024	uksc-2022-0103	Bertino (Appellant) v Public Prosecutor’s Office, Italy (Respondent)	The appellant’s extradition was sought pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant (“EAW”) issued on 6 February 2020 by the public prosecutor’s office of the Court of Pordenone (“the requesting judicial authority”) seeking to enforce a sentence of one year’s imprisonment imposed for a conviction of sexual activity with an underage person. The appellant had not been arrested or questioned formally after the offence, which was alleged to have taken place on 18 June 2015 at a holiday camp where the appellant was working. However on 23 July 2015 the appellant attended a police station in Sicily where he signed a document which recorded that he was under investigation and in which he elected Italy as his domicile. The document warned that if the appellant did not notify any change of domicile the service of any document would be executed by delivery to a defence lawyer either of the appellant’s choosing or of the court’s appointment. The appellant left Italy in November 2015 and came to the United Kingdom. The requesting judicial authority was subsequently unsuccessful in serving a writ of summons dated 12 June 2017 on the appellant, and the trial took place in his absence. The question of whether to extradite the appellant pursuant to the EAW was determined by a district judge by reference to the questions set out in section 20 of the Extradition Act 2003 (the “Act”) read in conformity with the 2002 Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002, as amended by Council Framework Decision 2009/299/JHA of 26 February 2009 (the “Amended Framework Decision”). The only issue for determination before the district judge arose under section 20(3) of the Act, namely whether the requested person “deliberately absented himself from his trial”. The district judge concluded that the appellant left the country so that he could not be served with court papers or future dates for his trial and that he demonstrated a ‘manifest lack of diligence’ in moving address without notifying the requesting judicial authority which was sufficient to establish deliberate absence under section 20(3) of the Act. The High Court dismissed the appellant’s appeal but certified the following point of law of general public importance: “For a requested person to have deliberately absented himself from trial for the purpose of section 20(3) of the Act, must the requesting judicial authority prove that he has actual knowledge that he could be convicted and sentenced in absentia?” The Supreme Court granted the appellant permission to appeal on this point.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. It holds that for a judge at an extradition hearing to be satisfied that a requested person was “deliberately absent from trial” within the meaning of section 20(3) of the Act, the requesting judicial authority must demonstrate to the criminal standard of proof that the requested person had unequivocally waived their right to be present at trial. Ordinarily that will require the requested person to have actual knowledge that they could be convicted and tried in their absence although there may be cases where the requested person’s behaviour is of a nature that establishes unequivocal waiver without establishing such knowledge. Lord Stephens and Lord Burnett give the lead judgment, with which Lord Hodge, Lord Sales and Lord Burrows agree.	The requesting judicial authority indicated in the EAW that the appellant had not been present at trial. However it did not rely on any of the criteria in the subsequent boxes which reflect the exceptions set out in article 4a(1) of the Amended Framework Decision to the discretion afforded to member states to refuse extradition where the requested person was not present at trial. If any of those criteria was established the appellant’s extradition would be required pursuant to the Amended Framework Decision [8], [44]. Those criteria are that the appellant was aware of the trial and the consequence of non-attendance or that he had given a mandate to a legal advisor who defended him at trial or that he was subsequently served with the decision to convict and informed of his right to a retrial or to an appeal amounting to a retrial and either expressly stated that he does not contest the decision or did not request a retrial [8]. The Amended Framework Decision recognises that the question of whether to extradite is a matter for domestic law when none of the criteria in article 4a(1) of the Framework Decision is satisfied. In this instance the applicable domestic law is found in section 20 of the Act [45]. The phrase “deliberately absented himself from his trial” in section 20(3) of the Act should be understood as having the same meaning as the concept in the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (the “Strasbourg Court”) in relation to the right to a fair trial guaranteed by article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, namely that an accused has unequivocally waived their right to be present at trial. The Strasbourg Court has emphasised the “capital” importance of the right of defendants to be present at their trials and also that a fair hearing requires that defendants are notified of the proceedings against them. Moreover, the Strasbourg Court has emphasised that the notification of the formal “accusation” to the defendant plays a crucial role because it is then that the defendant is put on notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges [47]. It is for the requesting judicial authority to prove to the criminal standard that the appellant had unequivocally waived his right to be present at his trial: see section 206 of the Act [48]. In this case, the appellant was under investigation. He had never been questioned or arrested or charged in connection with the alleged offending. The appellant was never officially informed that he was being prosecuted nor was he notified of the time and place of his trial [50]. The Supreme Court holds that the appellant’s conduct in leaving Italy was far removed from the sort of conduct envisaged by the Strasbourg Court which might justify a conclusion that the requested person had unequivocally waived their right to be present at trial [51]. The Strasbourg Court has been careful not to present the issue in the stark terms in which it was presented in the certified question before the Supreme Court in this case, although ordinarily it would be expected that the requesting judicial authority must prove that the requested person had actual knowledge that he could be convicted and sentenced in absentia [58]. The Strasbourg Court has been careful to leave open the precise boundaries of behaviour that would support a conclusion that the right to be present at trial had been unequivocally waived. The cases cited in the judgment in this appeal provide many examples where the Strasbourg Court has decided that a particular indicator does not itself support that conclusion. But the Supreme Court holds that behaviour of an extreme enough form might support a finding of unequivocal waiver even if an accused cannot be shown to have had actual knowledge that the trial would proceed in absence [58]. As indicated, the requesting judicial authority failed to establish to the criminal standard of proof that the appellant had unequivocally waived his right to be present at trial. The Supreme Court therefore allows the appeal, quashes the extradition order and orders the appellant’s discharge [59].			
2024	uksc-2022-0108	Lifestyle Equities CV and another (Respondents) v Amazon UK Services Ltd and others (Appellants)	This appeal concerns the application of EU and UK trade mark law to the cross-border marketing and sale of goods on the internet. The respondents (together, “Lifestyle”) are the owners and exclusive licensees of a number of UK and EU trade marks relating to the “BEVERLY HILLS POLO CLUB” brand (the “UK/EU Marks”). Corresponding trade marks in the USA are owned by a commercially unrelated entity, which produces goods identical to those for which Lifestyle’s trade marks are registered in the UK and EU (the “USA Branded Goods”). The appellants (together, “Amazon”) marketed and sold the USA Branded Goods on their USA website, which Lifestyle claims infringed its rights in the UK/EU Marks. It is important to note that the dispute relates entirely to events that occurred before the UK left the EU, and these proceedings began before 31 December 2020, the end of the implementation period provided for by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020. Thus, UK trade mark law was at that time substantially governed by EU legislation and case law. It was agreed before the Court of Appeal that the issues arising on the appeal concerning the EU Marks might be decided by reference to Regulation 2017/1001 on the European Union trade mark (the “EUTM Regulation”). It was also common ground that these issues were unaffected by Brexit. Article 9(2) of the EUTM Regulation provides (among other things) that the owner of an EU trade mark is entitled to prevent third parties from using in the course of trade, without the owner’s consent, any sign which is identical with the EU trade mark in relation to goods identical with those for which the EU trade mark is registered. Section 10(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994, which applies to UK trade marks, is in this respect in materially the same terms as Article 9(2) of the EUTM Regulation. Lifestyle claims in particular that Amazon targeted consumers in the UK/EU, in contravention of the above trade mark laws, by advertising and offering for sale the USA Branded Goods on its USA website. The High Court dismissed Lifestyle’s claims, concluding that the listings of the USA Branded Goods on Amazon’s USA website were not targeted at consumers in the UK/EU. The Court of Appeal allowed Lifestyle’s appeal, holding that the advertisements and offers for sale of the USA Branded Goods were targeted at consumers in the UK/EU. The Court of Appeal granted an injunction against two of the Amazon defendants, and permitted Lifestyle to pursue an enquiry as to the damages caused by the same defendants’ acts of infringement. Amazon now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Amazon’s appeal. It holds that Amazon targeted consumers in the UK by displaying the USA Branded Goods on its USA website and marking them available for shipment to the UK, which in turn infringed the UK/EU Marks. The injunction and order relating to an enquiry as to damages made by the Court of Appeal therefore remain in place. Lord Briggs and Lord Kitchin give a joint judgment, with which the other members of the Court agree.	The concept of targeting of a commercial activity carried on through a website was first explored by the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) in considering the jurisdiction of national courts of a member state over consumer contracts. However, it was adopted by the CJEU in the trade mark context in L’Oréal SA v eBay International AG (Case C-324/09). There the court accepted that the rules of Council Regulation (EC) 40/94 on the Community trade mark applied as soon as it was clear that an offer for sale of a trade marked product located in a third state was targeted at consumers in the territory covered by the trade mark. Were it otherwise, operators of foreign websites carrying advertisements of trade marked goods targeted at consumers in the EU would have no obligation to comply with EU intellectual property rules [15], [19]. In order to determine whether the marketing of goods on a foreign website is targeted at consumers within the relevant territory, here the UK, the question to be answered by the court is whether the average consumer, being someone who is reasonably well informed and reasonably observant, would consider the website to be directed at him or her. The mere accessibility of an overseas website to a UK consumer is not enough on its own to establish targeting of that consumer. The court must carry out a multifactorial assessment of all the relevant circumstances to assess the reaction of the average consumer and answer the question whether there is targeting [24]-[25], [27]-[29]. In this case it is therefore necessary for the court to conduct a close, contextual examination of the way in which Amazon’s USA website presents itself when accessed by a consumer situated in the UK. Following a review of the successive pages of the website which present or refer to the USA Branded Goods (or similar sample goods), the Supreme Court concludes that an average consumer in the UK/EU would consider the Amazon USA website to be directed at him or her. Particularly significant factors include: (i) a message on the landing page and almost all subsequent pages offering to deliver to the UK; (ii) specifying which of the goods displayed can be shipped to the UK; and (iii) a “Review your order” page offering to sell the relevant goods to a consumer at a UK address, with UK specific delivery times and the option to pay in sterling [60], [70]-[73], [80]. There are some contrary indicators, such as the option to use Amazon’s UK website and the default display of prices in US dollars, but these are greatly outweighed by the factors that point in the direction of targeting. The Supreme Court acknowledges that delivery times for UK consumers are likely to be faster, and charges lower, on the UK website as compared to the USA website, but it notes that this would not be easily apparent to the average consumer, and would not be relevant where, as in the present case, the branded goods are not to be displayed for sale on the UK website. The Court also disagrees with the judge’s view that Lifestyle’s motive for bringing these proceedings is relevant to the targeting question [70], [74]-[79]. The Supreme Court notes that an appellate court should not interfere with the evaluative decision of a first instance judge unless he or she has made an error of law or principle, or there is a flaw in the judge’s treatment of the evaluation, such as a gap in logic, a lack of consistency or a failure to consider some material factor, which undermines the cogency of the decision. It is not enough simply that the appellate court would have arrived at a different conclusion. The Supreme Court explains, by reference to the reasoning of the judge and the Court of Appeal, the reasons why it has carried out the balancing exercise afresh, rather than merely deciding that the Court of Appeal was entitled to reach the conclusion it did [49]-[50], [82]-[83], [86]-[87]. Lifestyle also contends that, even if the marketing of the USA Branded Goods was not targeted at consumers in the UK/EU, Amazon nonetheless infringed the UK/EU Marks by selling and delivering the goods through its USA website to consumers in the UK/EU. This argument relies on the decision of the CJEU in Blomqvist v Rolex SA (Case C-98/13). However, the report of that case does not provide a sufficiently detailed description of the underlying facts for the Supreme Court to form a reliable view as to whether it laid down a legal principle applicable to this case. Moreover, and in any event, in the present case the relevant marketing and offers for sale were targeted at consumers in the UK. Accordingly, the Supreme Court declines to decide this point [32], [88]-[89].			
2024	uksc-2022-0121	The Manchester Ship Canal Company Ltd (Appellant) v United Utilities Water Ltd (Respondent) (No 2)	This appeal forms part of long-running litigation about discharges of foul water contaminated with untreated sewage into the Manchester Ship Canal. The Supreme Court is asked to decide whether the owner of the beds and banks of the canal, the Manchester Ship Canal Company Ltd (“the Canal Company”), can bring a claim in nuisance or trespass when the canal is polluted by discharges of foul water from outfalls maintained by the statutory sewerage undertaker, United Utilities Water Ltd (“United Utilities”). United Utilities is the statutory sewerage undertaker for the North West of England. Its sewerage network includes around 100 outfalls from which material emanating from sewers, sewage treatment works and pumping stations is discharged into the canal. When it is operating within its hydraulic capacity, the discharges are of surface water or treated effluent, but when the system’s hydraulic capacity is exceeded at least some of the outfalls discharge foul water into the canal. There is no suggestion that these polluting discharges are caused by negligence or deliberate wrongdoing on the part of United Utilities. However, they could be avoided if United Utilities invested in improved infrastructure and treatment processes. The Canal Company threatened to bring a claim against United Utilities for trespass and nuisance. In response, United Utilities asked the court to make a declaration that the Canal Company had no right of action. The court was not asked to decide whether the Canal Company’s claim would be successful on the relevant facts. Rather, the question was whether the claim would be inconsistent with and therefore barred by the statutory scheme for regulating sewerage established by the Water Industry Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”). The High Court judge agreed to make the declaration requested by United Utilities. His decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The implication of these judgments is that no owner of a canal (or other watercourse or body of water) can bring a claim based on nuisance or trespass against a sewerage undertaker in respect of polluting discharges into the water, unless the sewerage undertaker is guilty of negligence or deliberate wrongdoing. A claim of this kind would be prevented even if the polluting discharges were frequent and had significant and damaging effects on the owner’s commercial or other interests, or on its ability to enjoy its property. The Canal Company appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the Canal Company’s appeal. It holds that the 1991 Act does not prevent the Canal Company from bringing a claim in nuisance or trespass when the canal is polluted by discharges of foul water from United Utilities’ outfalls, even if there has been no negligence or deliberate misconduct. Lord Reed and Lord Hodge give a joint judgment with which the other members of the Court agree.	The starting point is that the owner of a canal or other watercourse has a property right in the watercourse, including a right to preserve the quality of the water. That right is protected by the common law. The discharge of polluting effluent into a privately-owned watercourse is an actionable nuisance at common law if the pollution interferes with the owner’s use or enjoyment of its property. The Supreme Court is, therefore, asked to decide whether the 1991 Act excludes common law rights of action in nuisance and trespass. This is a question of statutory interpretation [108]-[110]. A body which exercises statutory powers, such as a sewerage undertaker, is liable in the same way as any other person if it is responsible for a nuisance, trespass or other tort, unless either it: (i) is acting within its statutory powers, or (ii) has been granted some statutory immunity from suit. If a sewerage undertaker interferes with a person’s rights, it is therefore necessary to distinguish between interferences which Parliament has authorised, which are lawful, and interferences which Parliament has not authorised, which are unlawful. When drawing this distinction, two principles are relevant. First, a person’s rights to the peaceful enjoyment of its property and to access the courts are protected by both the common law and the Human Rights Act 1998. The principle of legality holds that fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. A statute will, therefore, only authorise what would otherwise be an unlawful interference with property rights, or deprive a person of the right to bring a legal claim, if this is clear from or a necessary implication of the express language used by Parliament. Secondly, Parliament will not be taken to have intended that statutory powers should be exercised, or duties performed, in a way which interferes with private rights, unless the interference is inevitable [15]-[21]. The 1991 Act does not expressly authorise United Utilities to cause a nuisance or to trespass by discharging foul water through the outfalls into the canal. United Utilities’ entitlement to use the outfalls derives from section 116 of the 1991 Act. However, this entitlement is subject to a number of statutory protections for watercourses. Section 117(5) provides that nothing in section 116 (or the other relevant sewerage provisions of the 1991 Act) authorises a sewerage undertaker to use a sewer, drain or outfall to convey foul water into a watercourse. Sewerage undertakers therefore do not have statutory authority to discharge untreated sewage into watercourses. Section 117(6) prevents a sewerage undertaker from carrying out its functions under the relevant sewerage provisions so as to create a nuisance. Section 94(4) makes it clear that the common law remedies for nuisance – such as an injunction or damages – are available in addition to any remedy available by virtue of section 94. Section 186(3) further protects the owners of watercourses, and other rights-holders, by stating that nothing in the relevant sewerage provisions authorises a sewerage undertaker to damage a watercourse, or the quality of the water in it, without consent [60]-[62], [65], [111]-[112], [116]. The polluting discharges similarly cannot be regarded as having been impliedly authorised by Parliament, since they are not an inevitable consequence of a sewerage undertaker’s performance of its statutory powers and duties. In the present case, the discharges could be avoided if United Utilities invested in improved infrastructure and treatment processes [113]. If Parliament has not authorised an interference with private law rights, it would normally follow that a claimant can enforce those rights at common law. Furthermore, since sections 117(5) and 186(3) limit the authority conferred on sewerage undertakers by the 1991 Act, there must be a common law remedy where those limits are exceeded: otherwise, the sections would have no purpose [114]-[115]. However, United Utilities argues that the Canal Company has no cause of action because the only way to avoid the discharges of foul water into the canal would be to construct new sewerage infrastructure. It relies on the House of Lords’ decision in Marcic v Thames Water Utilities Ltd [2003] UKHL 66 (“Marcic”), which it says established that Parliament’s intention was that the construction of new sewerage infrastructure should be a matter for the Secretary of State or the regulator, the Water Services Regulation Authority (known as “Ofwat”), not the courts [106]. The Supreme Court rejects this argument. There are a number of indications that Parliament did not intend the 1991 Act to exclude a claimant’s right to enforce its private property right in a watercourse. First, section 186(7) provides for arbitration where water quality has been damaged without consent, at the option of the party complaining. This strongly suggests that the complainant could alternatively choose to pursue a common law claim [66], [117]. Secondly, section 180 of the 1991 Act gives effect to Schedule 12, which makes provision for statutory compensation. Compensation is available for damage caused by the authorised acts of sewerage undertakers, but not for damage caused by acts which are unauthorised, such as the discharges of foul water into the canal. This indicates that the victims of unauthorised damage retain their common law rights of action. Otherwise, they would be left without any remedy for the damage they have suffered, which would be anomalous. They would also be treated less favourably than the victims of authorised damage, which would be perverse [64], [118]-[121]. Thirdly, depriving the victims of a nuisance or trespass of their common law rights of action would be a substantial change to the law as it stood before the 1991 Act was enacted. It is unlikely that a change of this kind would have been made in a consolidation statute. Consolidation acts are not designed to make substantive changes to the law, but rather to reorganise and restate the existing law so that it is clearer and easier to understand. Moreover, since the 1991 Act is detailed and elaborate, it would be surprising if Parliament had left an important change in the law to be implied rather than stated expressly. In addition, the principle of legality holds that fundamental common law rights, such as a right of action to protect private property, are not to be taken to be overridden in the absence of express language or necessary implication [50], [53], [122]-[123]. United Utilities relies on section 18, which empowers the Secretary of State and Ofwat to make enforcement orders for the purpose of securing compliance by sewerage undertakers with statutory and certain other requirements. These include the general duty in section 94, which requires sewerage undertakers to provide a sewerage system. Section 18(8) makes it clear that it is not possible to enforce these statutory and other requirements by bringing a claim at common law; an order under section 18 provides the only available remedy. However, this ouster only applies to causes of action that are based on a breach of a statutory or other requirement that is enforceable under section 18. If a sewerage undertaker does something (or fails to do something) which gives rise to an independent common law cause of action, for example, for nuisance or trespass, the 1991 Act does not prevent the courts from enforcing the claimant’s common law rights and awarding any available common law remedies [56]-[59], [124], [133]. The Supreme Court accepts that the regulatory scheme established by the 1991 Act, including the making of enforcement orders under section 18, might be disrupted if the court were to grant injunctions which required a sewerage undertaker to spend large sums on new infrastructure as a remedy for interferences with private property rights. That might be so if such an injunction conflicted with the arrangements in the Act for the regulatory approval of capital expenditure and the charges imposed on the sewerage undertaker’s customers. However, this does not mean that common law rights of action are excluded in such a case. Instead, the courts may make an award in damages, both for past invasions of property rights and for future or repeated invasions of those rights. This would vindicate property rights in relation to watercourses until the sewerage undertaker is in a position, with Ofwat’s approval, to invest in a long-term solution [116], [125]-[132]. The Supreme Court’s conclusion that the 1991 Act does not prevent the Canal Company from bringing a claim in nuisance or trespass when the canal is polluted by discharges of foul water from United Utilities’ outfalls can be reconciled with the decision in Marcic. That case can be distinguished, first, because it did not concern the limits on the authority conferred on sewerage undertakers by the 1991 Act set out in sections 117(5) and 186(3). Secondly, the defendant sewerage undertaker had not created or adopted the relevant nuisance, as it has in the present case. Instead, it was said to be liable for continuing the nuisance by failing to take reasonable steps to avert it by constructing a new public sewer. An essential ingredient of the cause of action was therefore that the defendant was under a duty to build a new sewer, in accordance with section 94(1) of the 1991 Act. That duty could only be enforced by the Secretary of State or Ofwat under section 18, not by the courts. In contrast, the Canal Company’s proposed claim against United Utilities is not based on a breach of section 94(1), or any other requirement enforceable under section 18, but rather on independent common law causes of action in trespass and nuisance [82]-[90], [95], [105], [135]-[136].			
2024	uksc-2022-0124	Abbey Healthcare (Mill Hill) Ltd (Respondent) v Augusta 2008 LLP (formerly Simply Construct (UK) LLP) (Appellant)	This appeal concerns whether the collateral warranty given by the Appellant (“Simply”) to the Respondent (“Abbey”) is a ‘construction contract’ within the meaning of section 104(1)(a) Housing Grants (Construction & Regeneration) Act 1996 (the “1996 Act”) so as to give rise to a right to statutory adjudication. Collateral warranties give third parties contractual rights against contractors should defects arise in respect of the works carried out by them. It is common practice in the construction industry for collateral warranties to be provided to third parties. Simply is a contractor under a JCT Design and Build Contract 2011 (the “Building Contract”) dated 29 June 2015. Simply was engaged by its employer Sapphire Building Services Ltd (“Sapphire”) to design and build a 65 bedroom care home at Holder Hill Road, Mill Hill, London (the “Property”). On 10 October 2016 Simply completed works on the Property. On 14 June 2017, the Building Contract was novated from Sapphire to Toppan Holdings Ltd (“Toppan”). On 12 August 2017, Toppan granted a 21 year lease of the Property to Abbey. In August 2018, Toppan discovered alleged fire safety defects at the Property. Simply was notified of the defects and requested to rectify them, which Simply did not do. Toppan subsequently engaged a third party contractor to conduct remedial works, paid for by Abbey. On 23 September 2020 Toppan Simply provided a collateral warranty to Abbey and Toppan. Toppan and Abbey made claims against Simply arising out of the fire safety defects and costs of remedial works. On 11 December Toppan and Abbey each referred to adjudication a dispute regarding the alleged defects, seeking sums in excess of £8.8m and £5.5m respectively. Mr Peter Vinden (“the Adjudicator”) issued his decisions on 30 April 2021 finding for Toppan and Abbey on liability. Simply did not pay the sums due. On 12 May 2021, Toppan and Abbey issued proceedings in the Technology and Construction Court to enforce the decisions by way of summary judgment. Mr Martin Bowdery QC sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge (the “Judge”) granted summary judgment in respect of Toppan and dismissed the summary judgment application on the grounds that the warranty given to Abbey (the “Abbey Collateral Warranty”) was not a construction contract within the meaning of section 104(1) of the 1996 Act and therefore the Adjudicator lacked jurisdiction. Abbey appealed to the Court of Appeal. All members agreed that a collateral warranty could be a construction contract and a majority held that the Abbey Collateral Warranty was such a contract with Stuart-Smith LJ dissenting on the latter issue. On 21 December 2022, the Supreme Court granted Simply permission to appeal to the Supreme Court on the question of whether or not the Abbey Collateral Warranty is a construction contract within the meaning of the 1996 Act.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Hamblen gives the judgment with which Lord Briggs, Lady Rose, Lord Richards and Lady Simler agree.	The appeal raises two issues: 1. What is the meaning of an agreement “for… the carrying out of construction operations” in section 104(1) of the 1996 Act (the “statutory interpretation issue”)? 2. How should the Abbey Collateral Warranty be construed and, so construed, is it an agreement “for… the carrying out of construction operations (the “contractual interpretation issue”)? The statutory interpretation issue Section 104(1) requires an assessment of whether the object or purpose of the agreement is the carrying out of construction operations [64]. The purpose of a collateral warranty is usually to afford a right of action in respect of defectively carried out construction works and not the carrying out of such construction operations themselves [65]. Such a warranty does not give rise to the carrying out of such operations; it is the building contract which does so. A collateral warranty that promises the beneficiary that the construction operations undertaken in the building contract will be performed derives from and mirrors the promise to perform obligations owed to someone else and typically provides the beneficiary with no control as to how those operations are performed [66-69]. In these circumstances, the Court concludes that a collateral warranty will not be an agreement “for” the carrying out of construction operations if it merely promises to perform obligations owed to someone else under the building contract. There needs to be a separate or distinct obligation to carry out construction operations for the beneficiary; not one which is merely derivative and reflective of obligations owed under the building contract [70]. Contractual interpretation issue The majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that the Abbey Collateral Warranty was a construction contract. Critical to the decision of the majority was their interpretation of clause 4.1(a) of the Abbey Collateral Warranty under which Simply promised to Abbey that it “has performed and will continue to perform” its obligations under the Building Contract. Whilst this is a promise to Abbey to carry out the works, it is an entirely derivative promise and the contractor is not thereby promising anything that is not already promised under the Building Contract [72]. On the approach of the majority, any collateral warranty which contains a promise in similar terms to clause 4.1(a) will bring the agreement within section 104(1), even where all construction operations have been performed at the time of the execution [73]. The approach of the majority also means that whether or not a collateral warranty falls within section 104(1) will depend on the niceties of the language used and may lead to parties drawing fine distinctions in relation to the drafting and interpretation of collateral warranties [75]. A more principled and workable approach is to draw the dividing line between collateral warranties which merely replicate undertakings in the building contract and those which give rise to separate or distinct undertakings for the carrying out of construction operations [76]. This approach means that the Abbey Collateral Warranty is not a construction contract. It is also likely to mean that most collateral warranties will not be construction contracts [77]. There are, however, good reasons for concluding that, in general, such warranties were not intended to fall within the scope of the 1996 Act such as the fact that the various payment related provisions of the 1996 Act (sections 109 to 113) are inapplicable to collateral warranties and that one of the main purposes of the 1996 Act, improvement of cashflow, is not furthered by its application to collateral warranties. This conclusion means that the decision of Akenhead J in Parkwood Leisure Ltd v Laing O’Rourke Wales and West Ltd [2013] EWHC 2665 (TCC), upon which the majority of the Court of Appeal placed considerable reliance and rightly held to be indistinguishable, was wrongly decided and must be overruled.			
2024	uksc-2022-0127	Merticariu (Appellant) v Judecatoria Arad, Romania (Respondent)	The appellant was arrested in England on 25 September 2019 pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant (“EAW”) issued by the respondent (“the requesting judicial authority”). The EAW was issued on the basis of a sentence imposed on the appellant by a Romanian court on 11 April 2019 for burglary. The question of whether to extradite the appellant pursuant to the EAW was determined by a district judge by reference to the questions set out in section 20 of the Extradition Act 2003 (the “Act”) read in conformity with the 2002 Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002, as amended by Council Framework Decision 2009/299/JHA of 26 February 2009 (the “Amended Framework Decision”). The district judge found that the appellant had not been present at trial and had not deliberately absented himself from trial. The district judge was therefore required by section 20(5) of the Act to ask whether the appellant “would be entitled to a retrial or (on appeal) to a review amounting to a retrial” on return to Romania. The district judge concluded that the appellant had a right to a retrial in Romania even though he was required to make an application for a retrial in Romania and the success of that application was contingent on the appellant demonstrating that he had not deliberately absented himself from trial. The district judge therefore ordered the appellant’s extradition. The High Court dismissed the appellant’s appeal but certified the following points as points of law of general public importance for the Supreme Court to determine: “In a case where the appropriate judge has decided the questions in section 20(1) and (3) of the Extradition Act 2003 in the negative, can the appropriate judge answer the question in section 20(5) in the affirmative if (a) the law of the requesting state confers a right to retrial which depends on a finding by a judicial authority of that state as to whether the requested person was deliberately absent from his trial; and (b) it is not possible to say that a finding of deliberate absence is ‘theoretical’ or ‘so remote that it can be discounted’? If so, in what circumstances?” The Supreme Court granted permission for the appellant to appeal on these points of law.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. It holds that to establish that a requested person would be entitled to a retrial or (on appeal) to a review amounting to a retrial on return to the requesting state the entitlement must not be dependent on any contingency, except for purely procedural matters such as making an application in the manner and in the time prescribed in the requesting state. Lord Stephens and Lord Burnett give the lead judgment, with which Lord Hodge, Lord Sales and Lord Burrows agree.	The short point in this appeal concerns the proper construction of section 20(5) of the Act. The Supreme Court holds that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words in section 20(5) of the Act are plain [51]. The judge must decide whether the requested person is “entitled” to a retrial or (on appeal) to a review amounting to a retrial. Section 20(5) does not require the judge to decide a different question, namely whether the requested person is “entitled to apply for a retrial” [51]. An entitlement to a retrial cannot be contingent on the court in the requesting state making a factual finding that the requested person was not present at or was not deliberately absent from their trial [51]. The Supreme Court considers that a requested person may have the right to a retrial even if the domestic law of the requesting state requires him to take “procedural steps” to invoke the right [52]. But if the entitlement to a retrial is contingent on a finding that the requested person was not deliberately absent from his trial, the proceedings leading to that finding would not naturally be referred to as a “procedural step”. Rather, those proceedings in the requesting state should be regarded as involving a decision on a substantive issue [52]. The Supreme Court’s interpretation of section 20(5) of the Act is supported by the wording in article 4a(1) of the Amended Framework Decision which replaced the phrase “an opportunity to apply for retrial” in the 2002 Council Framework with the phrase “right to a retrial” [53]. It is also consistent with the scope of the right to be present at trial under article 6 of the Convention as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights [54]. The Supreme Court holds that the appropriate judge cannot answer section 20(5) of the 2003 Act in the affirmative if the law of the requesting state confers a right to retrial which depends on a finding by a judicial authority in the requesting state as to whether the requested person was deliberately absent from his trial [63]. In this case, neither the EAW nor the further information provided by the requesting judicial authority confirmed that the appellant was entitled to a retrial [65]. The district judge in this case should therefore have answered section 20(5) in the negative. Accordingly, the Supreme Court quashes the district judge’s order and orders the appellant’s discharge [68].			
2024	uksc-2022-0135	Mueen-Uddin (Appellant) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent)	In this appeal, the Supreme Court is asked to decide whether the High Court was right to strike out as an abuse of process Mr Mueen-Uddin’s claim against the Home Secretary for libel and breach of statutory duty pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation. The claim concerns allegations published in a Home Office Commission for Countering Extremism report entitled “Challenging Hateful Extremism” (“the Report”). Mr Mueen-Uddin was born in East Bengal, which then formed part of Pakistan but is now Bangladesh. In 1971, Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan following a war of independence. Many atrocities were committed, including the abduction and murder of 18 prominent intellectuals. Mr Mueen-Uddin left Bangladesh in December 1971, after he became aware of allegations that he had been a member of the militia said to be responsible for the intellectuals’ deaths. He denies having been involved in any violence. He arrived in the United Kingdom in 1973 and became a British citizen in 1984. He has held a number of prominent public and charitable positions in British society, and helped to set up the Muslim Council of Great Britain. In 2013, Mr Mueen-Uddin was tried and convicted in his absence by the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal (“ICT”) for war crimes, namely the murder of the 18 intellectuals. He was sentenced to death. The ICT was widely criticised internationally – including by the United Nations, foreign governments and human rights organisations – for failing to respect minimum fair trial guarantees and for lacking judicial independence. Mr Mueen-Uddin’s conviction was reported by the media in the United Kingdom. The media reports noted the criticisms of the ICT, and that Mr Mueen-Uddin denied the charges against him and maintained that the trial was unfair and politically motivated. In October 2019, the Home Office published the Report. A section entitled “What Extremism Looks Like in England and Wales” contained a footnote which stated that links between those responsible for the violence in Bangladesh in 1971 and community leadership in East London were well established, and referred to Mr Mueen-Uddin’s ICT conviction. In June 2020, Mr Mueen-Uddin issued proceedings against the Home Secretary. At a preliminary hearing, the High Court held that the words used in the Report meant that Mr Mueen-Uddin “(i) was one of those responsible for war crimes committed during a 1971 War of Independence in South Asia; and (ii) has committed crimes against humanity during a 1971 War of Independence in South Asia.” The High Court held that these allegations were defamatory. The Home Secretary applied to have Mr Mueen-Uddin’s claim struck out on the basis that it was an abuse of the court’s process. The High Court agreed to strike out the claim, and its decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. Mr Mueen-Uddin appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows Mr Mueen-Uddin’s appeal. It holds that the order striking out his claim as an abuse of process should be set aside, and that he should be permitted to pursue his claim against the Home Secretary at trial. Lord Reed gives the judgment, with which the other members of the Court agree.	The Home Secretary relies on the court’s inherent power to prevent its process from being misused, or abused, in a way which would be manifestly unfair to one or more of the parties or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The primary purpose of this power is to preserve public confidence in the administration of justice [36]-[39]. The Home Secretary argues that Mr Mueen-Uddin’s claim is an abuse of process because it falls within two well-established categories of abusive proceedings. The first is known as “Hunter abuse” following the House of Lords’ decision in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police [1982] AC 529. The second is “Jameel abuse” following the Court of Appeal decision in Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones & Co Inc [2005] EWCA Civ 75 [41]. Hunter abuse arises where a claimant uses proceedings to mount a collateral attack on a final decision made by a court of competent jurisdiction in earlier criminal or civil proceedings. A claimant who wishes to challenge a decision made against him should normally do so by appealing that decision. The courts should not generally permit him to pursue new proceedings in order to re-litigate matters which he had a full opportunity to contest in the earlier proceedings [43]-[46]. Allowing this would give rise to a risk that the decisions in the two sets of proceedings would be inconsistent, bringing the administration of justice into disrepute [51]-[58]. Not every collateral challenge to earlier proceedings will amount to Hunter abuse. The Hunter principle only applies where the earlier proceedings were fair, and where they provided the claimant with a full opportunity to contest the court’s decision [44], [50], [52], [58], [59]-[62]. Accordingly, a collateral challenge to an earlier foreign criminal conviction will not necessarily amount to an abuse of process, particularly where there are concerns that the accused did not have a fair opportunity to put his case and to meet the case made against him. In cases of this kind, the court must judge the procedural quality of the earlier foreign proceedings [47]-[50]. Applying this to the present case, Mr Mueen-Uddin’s claim against the Home Secretary cannot amount to Hunter abuse because he did not have a full opportunity to contest the ICT’s decision to convict him. He was tried in his absence and was unable to give instructions to counsel appointed to represent him. There was no real possibility of an appeal against the conviction [63]-[64]. Potential evidential difficulties for the Secretary of State in establishing a defence of truth do not render Mr Mueen-Uddin’s claim an abuse of process. Mr Mueen-Uddin’s claim is not stale, and was issued promptly after the Report was published. He is not responsible for any evidential difficulties the Home Secretary may face in proving the truth of the allegations, which are in any case a matter of speculation. If the Home Secretary will find it difficult to substantiate the allegations made about murders committed more than 50 years ago, that should have been considered before the allegations were published in the Report [65]-[71]. Defamation proceedings will be struck out on the basis of Jameel abuse if they do not serve the legitimate purpose of protecting the claimant’s reputation because the damage suffered by the claimant is so trivial that it does not pass a minimum threshold of seriousness [72]-[81]. Mr Mueen-Uddin’s claim against the Home Secretary is not abusive in the Jameel sense. The allegations published in the Report are plainly very serious, and Mr Mueen-Uddin is offering to prove that they have caused more than minimal damage to his reputation in the United Kingdom [6], [90]-[91]. The Court of Appeal was wrong to conclude that Mr Mueen-Uddin’s claim was of little value because the Report could not have damaged his reputation. The effect of the publication on Mr Mueen-Uddin’s reputation is a matter of fact to be determined at trial. The fact that the same allegations have previously been reported by other publications cannot be relied on in mitigation of damages, and Mr Mueen-Uddin’s conviction by the ICT is not conclusive [90]-[110]. It should not be assumed that the people who read the relevant footnote in the Report must have had an unusually developed interest in its subject and would therefore already have been aware of the ICT conviction [111]-[115]. The Court of Appeal was also wrong to conclude that Mr Mueen-Uddin’s claim could not possibly vindicate his reputation. Mr Mueen-Uddin has a legitimate interest in protecting his reputation against the extremely serious allegations the government has made against him. If he succeeds at trial, it is reasonable to expect that this would be a major vindication of his reputation [116]-[120]. Finally, the Supreme Court rejects the Home Secretary’s submission that the court can consider matters relevant to Hunter and Jameel abuse together, so that even if neither type of abuse can be established on its own, considerations relevant to each of them can contribute cumulatively to the conclusion that Mr Mueen-Uddin’s claim is an abuse of process. Hunter abuse and Jameel abuse protect different aspects of the public interest and have different rationales. The considerations relevant to each principle cannot therefore simply be lumped together [121]-[122].			
2024	uksc-2022-0147	George (Respondent) v Cannell and another (Appellants)	This appeal concerns the civil wrong of malicious falsehood, which is committed when someone maliciously publishes words that cause another person financial loss. The main issues raised are: (1) whether section 3(1) of the Defamation Act 1952 removed the need, in specified circumstances, for a claimant to prove their financial loss to establish a defendant’s liability for this wrong; and (2) if so, whether a claimant who successfully relies on section 3(1) can recover damages for injury to feelings related to the publication of the malicious falsehood, even if no financial loss has been caused to them. The claimant, Fiona George, was an employee of the second defendant, LCA Jobs Ltd, a recruitment agency owned and operated by the first defendant, Linda Cannell. After resigning from LCA, the claimant was employed by another recruitment agency. She soon began targeting LCA’s clients. Linda Cannell told two third parties, one of whom was the claimant’s new line manager and the other a client of LCA, that by doing this the claimant was in breach of her contract of employment with LCA. In fact, as Linda Cannell knew, there was no term of that contract which prohibited the claimant from soliciting business from LCA’s clients. On a claim for damages for malicious falsehood, the High Court judge found that the statements made to the two third parties were false and malicious (because Linda Cannell did not believe them to be true); but that they had not caused the claimant any financial loss (because she showed a copy of her contract to her line manager, who saw that it contained no relevant restriction, and because the client of LCA whom she had approached had decided not to do business with her new employer anyway). The judge also held that the claim could not succeed in the absence of any financial loss and, therefore, dismissed the claim. On appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed this decision, holding that it was sufficient to establish liability under section 3(1) that the false statements were likely to cause financial loss, even though no such loss had in fact occurred. The Court of Appeal also held that, because liability was made out, the claimant could recover damages for injury to her feelings. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court.	By a three-to-two majority, the Supreme Court allows the appeal. The Supreme Court unanimously holds that the effect of section 3(1) is to enable a claimant to establish liability for malicious falsehood where a falsehood is likely to cause financial loss even if, in fact, it does not; but that the claimant can only recover damages (other than merely nominal damages) for financial loss actually suffered. For reasons given by Lord Leggatt (with whom Lord Hodge and Lord Richards agree) the majority of the court also holds that compensation for injury to feelings can only be recovered if such injury is consequent on financial loss caused by a maliciously false statement. As no financial loss was caused here, the claimant is entitled only to nominal damages. Lord Hamblen and Lord Burrows dissent on this issue.	Effect of section 3(1) Section 3(1) of the Defamation Act 1952 provides that, in an action for malicious falsehood, “it shall not be necessary to allege or prove special damage” if the words upon which the action is founded “are calculated to cause pecuniary damage” to the claimant and are published in writing or are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the claimant in respect of any office, profession, calling, trade or business [18]. The background to this provision is that, under the common law, proof of financial damage is an essential ingredient of a claim for malicious falsehood; so that, unless it is proved that the publication of the words has caused quantifiable financial loss to the claimant, no wrong has been committed. The defendants argued that, where section 3(1) applies, it creates a rebuttable presumption that financial loss is likely to have resulted from the publication of the false words (even without evidence of such loss), but does not make the defendant liable if the evidence shows that no financial loss actually occurred [47]–[50]. The Supreme Court rejects that argument. In the context of the Act, the term “special damage” means actual pecuniary damage (ie financial loss). Whether the words published “are calculated to cause pecuniary damage” is to be judged at the time of publication by asking whether, given the facts which the defendant knew or should have known when publishing the words, their publication was likely to cause the claimant financial loss [68], [80]–[82], [199]. If this condition is fulfilled, there is an irrebuttable presumption that financial loss was caused. There is, however, no presumption as to the amount of such loss. So the claimant can only recover damages which are more than merely nominal for financial loss which he or she has actually suffered as a result of the publication [51]. Here, the false statements made by Linda Cannell to third parties were, on the facts known to her, likely to cause the claimant financial loss even though, as it turned out, no loss was actually suffered [83]–[84]. Liability was therefore established, although the claimant had suffered no financial loss for which (more than purely nominal) damages can be recovered [89]. Damages for injury to feelings The claimant argued that, where liability is established as it has been here, damages can be recovered for injury to feelings caused by the publication of the malicious falsehood, even if the claimant has suffered no financial loss. The majority of the Supreme Court rejects that argument. Malicious falsehood is described as an “economic tort” because it protects purely economic interests. Under the common law financial damage is an essential element of the wrong, which consists in the infliction of financial loss by maliciously publishing false words. Where the infliction of such loss results in injury to the claimant’s feelings - for example, because the publication of a malicious falsehood badly damages the claimant’s business, causing him acute distress and anxiety about his livelihood and his family’s future - the damages awarded can include compensation for these injured feelings as well as for the financial loss caused. But the claimant cannot recover damages for hurt and indignation caused simply by learning that the defendant has published false and malicious words about the claimant because emotional wellbeing is not an interest protected by the law of malicious falsehood: causing injury to feelings by maliciously publishing false words is not a legal wrong [102]–[105]. Section 3(1) has not altered this. Where section 3(1) applies, it gives rise to a presumption of financial loss. But it was not intended to transform an economic tort into a psychological one and cannot reasonably be interpreted as having this effect. Thus, section 3(1) does not enable the claimant to recover compensation for injury to feelings caused by the publication of a malicious falsehood where the injury to feelings is not consequential on any economic damage (because none has been suffered) [57]–[59], [106]–[113]. In relation to any wrongdoing, if the defendant’s conduct in committing the wrong or in responding to the claim was especially insulting, “aggravated damages” may be awarded [92]; but there was no such conduct here [114]–[119]. Accordingly, the claimant is entitled only to nominal damages. Lord Hamblen and Lord Burrows disagree. They start from the principle (in agreement with the majority) that the claimant is entitled to compensation for all pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss caused by the tort, subject to normal rules restricting or diminishing damages such as remoteness and mitigation [234]. Given that the effect of section 3(1) is to render malicious falsehood actionable per se it logically follows from that starting principle that mental distress damages are recoverable for malicious falsehood (subject to remoteness etc). In their view, it is inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision (above) that section 3(1) turns the tort of malicious falsehood into a tort actionable without proof of pecuniary loss, to then conclude that mental distress damages should only be awarded on proof of pecuniary loss. It would be artificial and arbitrary for the availability of mental distress damages to turn on whether, for example, the claimant can prove that he or she has suffered a small pecuniary loss [234(vi)–(vii)]. They would therefore have upheld the order of the Court of Appeal that the case should be remitted to the trial judge to carry out an assessment of damages for injured feelings [235]–[236].			
2024	uksc-2022-0162	Argentum Exploration Ltd (Respondent) v Republic of South Africa (Appellant)	On 23 November 1942, SS TILAWA (“the Vessel”) was sunk in the Indian Ocean by enemy action. On board was a cargo of 2,364 bars of silver being carried from Bombay to Durban (“the Silver”). The Silver belonged to the Union of South Africa, now the Republic of South Africa. It had been purchased for the predominant purpose of being made into coin by the South African mint. As of 2020, the Silver had an estimated value of approximately US$ 43 million. In 2017, the Silver was recovered from the seabed at a depth of some 2½ kilometres by a specialist salvage vessel. It was carried to the United Kingdom and declared to the Receiver of Wreck. Argentum claims to be the salvor (rescuer) of the Silver and argues it is entitled to a claim for salvage – ie payment for recovering the Silver from the seabed. Under maritime law, it is possible to make a claim for voluntary salvage, which means a salvor can make a claim regardless of whether the owner of the property requested or consented to the salvage operation. In this case, Argentum had retrieved the Silver without any prior agreement with South Africa, so its claim was for voluntary salvage. A salvage claim can be made in personam (against a specific person: in this case, South Africa as the owner of the Silver) or in rem (against the thing itself: in this case, the Silver). In rem claims provide certain procedural advantages. For example, the claim can be served by fixing a claim form to the property itself, rather than serving the claim form on the property’s owner. In rem proceedings also generally provide a right to arrest the property in question which can act as security for the claim. In these proceedings, Argentum brought its claim for salvage in rem against the Silver, rather than in personam against South Africa. South Africa argued that the High Court had no power to hear Argentum’s claim because of the principle of state immunity, meaning that it could not be sued because of its sovereign status as a foreign state. Argentum argued that South Africa did not have immunity, because the exception to immunity under section 10(4)(a) of the State Immunity Act 1978 applied. Based on the wording of that exception, the argument between the parties primarily turned on whether the Silver was “in use or intended for use for commercial purposes” when it was being carried at sea in November 1942. The High Court found in favour of Argentum, holding that the Silver was in use for commercial purposes, as did a majority in the Court of Appeal. South Africa now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows South Africa’s appeal. It holds that the Silver was not in use nor intended for use for commercial purposes at the time when the cause of action arose. Therefore, South Africa is entitled to immunity from Argentum’s in rem claim against the Silver. Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lord Hamblen give a joint judgment with which the other members of the Court agree.	Section 10(4)(a) of the State Immunity Act 1978 provides that a state is not immune as respects an action in rem against a cargo belonging to that state if both the cargo and the ship carrying it were, at the time when the cause of action arose, in use or intended for use for commercial purposes. This is a higher threshold than for an action in personam which may be brought if the ship’s use was for commercial purposes (section 10(4)(b)). It is common ground between the parties that the Vessel was in use for commercial purposes when it was carrying the Silver. It is also now common ground between the parties that the Silver on board was not intended for use for commercial purposes: its predominant intended use was the sovereign purpose of minting currency. As a result, the central issue between the parties on this appeal is whether the Silver was “in use… for commercial purposes” within section 10(4)(a) when it was being carried on board the Vessel in 1942 [66]. Argentum argues that the Silver was in use for commercial purposes because of the commercial arrangements under which it was being shipped to South Africa. The Court rejects this submission. At the outset, to say that the Silver was “in use” while it was being carried on board the Vessel does not accord with the ordinary and natural meaning of those words. Cargo sitting in the hold of a ship is not being used for any purpose, commercial or otherwise [69]. If Argentum’s interpretation were correct, it would defeat Parliament’s intention to make separate provision for state immunity from actions in rem against state-owned cargoes as compared with actions in personam for enforcing a claim in connection with such a cargo. To bring an action in rem against a state-owned cargo, Parliament has imposed additional threshold criteria that the cargo in question must also be in use or intended for use for commercial purposes. If it were right to say that when a cargo is carried on a commercial vessel it is in use for commercial purposes, the additional threshold criteria for actions in rem would be made redundant [78]. Proceedings in rem are far more intrusive into the rights of a state over its property than proceedings in personam. In particular, the mere issue of a claim in rem gives the claimant the status of a secured creditor and encumbers the property with that claim; the property is the subject matter of the claim and, in relation to claims for salvage of cargo, there is a maritime lien over the cargo; jurisdiction is established merely by the presence of the property within the jurisdiction; the establishment of jurisdiction puts the property owner in the difficult position of facing a choice between appearing and defending the claim or staying away and losing its property, and issuing the claim gives rise to a right to arrest the property. There are therefore compelling reasons why more stringent criteria should be satisfied before a state is denied immunity [79]-[87]. Section 10 of the State Immunity Act 1978 was enacted to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the Brussels Convention of 1926. The provisions of that Convention further support South Africa’s interpretation of section 10(4)(a) and the conclusion that Parliament intended a distinct approach for immunity from in rem proceedings [90]-[97]. The majority of the Court of Appeal rejected South Africa’s submission that, because the Silver was not in use at all when carried on board a ship, the focus of the Court’s inquiry should be on the Government’s intended use for the Silver. The majority’s approach to the relevance of the intended use of the cargo in the application of section 10(4)(a) is erroneous [99]-[110]. It is not necessary to read down section 10(4)(a) under section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 to be compatible with the right of access to a court under article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In enacting section 10(4)(a), the United Kingdom Parliament had the legitimate aim of giving effect to the restrictive theory of immunity in international law so as to enable it to become a party to the Brussels Convention. The measure is also proportionate. The immunity claimed by South Africa applies only to proceedings in rem and it is common ground that it does not preclude proceedings in personam [114]. More generally, in the circumstances of the case, the grant of immunity from proceedings in rem on the basis of the intended use of the property for sovereign purposes conforms with and is required by general principles of international law [115].			
2024	uksc-2022-0172	RTI Ltd (Respondent) v MUR Shipping BV (Appellant)	This appeal concerns the interpretation of a force majeure clause in a shipping contract between MUR Shipping BV (“MUR”) and RTI Ltd (“RTI”). A force majeure clause relieves a party from its obligation to perform under a contract on the occurrence of specified events that are beyond the reasonable control of the parties (eg acts of God). Force majeure clauses commonly include a “reasonable endeavours” proviso, providing that a party cannot rely on what would otherwise be a force majeure event if that party could avoid its effects by the exercise of reasonable endeavours. The central issue in this appeal is whether the exercise of reasonable endeavours may require the party affected, if it is to be entitled to rely on the force majeure clause, to accept an offer of non-contractual performance from the other contracting party in order to overcome the effects of the specified event. Although this question arises in relation to a specific force majeure clause, it has significant implications for the interpretation of reasonable endeavours provisos and force majeure clauses more generally. On 9 June 2016, MUR and RTI entered a contract of affreightment based on an amended Gencon standard form voyage charterparty. MUR (the shipowner) agreed to make monthly shipments of bauxite from Conakry in Guinea to Dneprobugsky in Ukraine, between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2018. RTI agreed to make monthly payments to MUR, in US dollars. Clause 36 of the contract was a force majeure clause. Clause 36.3(d) of the contract was a reasonable endeavours proviso. It stipulated that the specified event would only be a force majeure event if “it cannot be overcome by reasonable endeavors from the Party affected.” On 6 April 2018, RTI’s parent company was sanctioned by the US government. The parties now agree that this was highly likely to create difficulties in RTI making timely contractual payments in US dollars. MUR claimed that this constituted a force majeure event and suspended the shipments of bauxite, relying on the force majeure clause. RTI disputed this and offered: (i) to make payments to MUR in Euros, which could then be converted into US dollars by MUR’s bank on receipt; and (ii) to indemnify MUR for any loss it suffered as a result. MUR rejected RTI’s offer. RTI commenced arbitration against MUR for breach of contract. MUR argued that it was permitted to suspend performance under the force majeure clause. RTI argued that MUR could not rely on the clause, because, in rejecting RTI’s offer, it had not satisfied the reasonable endeavours proviso. The arbitrators agreed with RTI, and awarded it damages for MUR’s breach of contract. MUR appealed to the High Court. Jacobs J allowed MUR’s appeal, on the basis that the reasonable endeavours proviso did not require MUR to accept an offer of non-contractual performance before it could rely on the force majeure clause. RTI appealed to the Court of Appeal, which allowed its appeal by a majority (with Arnold LJ dissenting). The majority held that the event could have been “overcome” by accepting RTI’s offer as this would have achieved the same result and would have involved no detriment to MUR. It therefore would have constituted reasonable endeavours in this case. MUR now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. MUR’s rejection of RTI’s offer of non-contractual performance did not constitute a failure to exercise reasonable endeavours and therefore the reasonable endeavours proviso did not prevent MUR from relying on the force majeure clause. Lord Hamblen and Lord Burrows give the judgment, with which Lord Hodge, Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lord Richards agree.	The majority in the Court of Appeal treated this as a case turning on the wording of the specific force majeure clause and, in particular, the use of the word “overcome” in the reasonable endeavours proviso. However, reasonable endeavours provisos are commonly found in force majeure clauses, either expressly or impliedly, and in materially similar terms to the clause in this case. It followed that the issue raised is one of general application which should be addressed as a matter of principle [25] – [30]. MUR was correct that, absent express wording, a reasonable endeavours proviso does not require acceptance of an offer of non-contractual performance. This conclusion is supported by principle and the authorities. There are several reasons of principle which support MUR’s case. First, force majeure clauses, and reasonable endeavours provisos, concern the causal effects of impediments to contractual performance. The party affected must be able to show that the force majeure event caused the failure to perform. That means establishing that the failure to perform could not have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable endeavours. Contractual performance means performance of the contract according to its terms. Failure to perform means a failing to perform in accordance with those terms. The causal question is to be addressed by reference to the parameters of the contract. The object of a reasonable endeavours proviso is to maintain, not alter that contractual performance [36] – [40]. Second, the principle of freedom of contract includes the freedom not to contract. This extends to the freedom not to accept non-contractual performance [41] – [42]. Third, clear words are needed to forego valuable contractual rights. Under the contract, MUR had an undoubted right to insist on payment in US dollars and to refuse payment in any other currency. RTI’s interpretation is inconsistent with the general principle that contractual parties do not forego their valuable rights without it being made clear that that was their intention [43] – [46]. Fourth, certainty and predictability are of particular importance in the context of English commercial law. MUR’s case is straightforward: absent clear wording, a reasonable endeavours proviso does not require acceptance of an offer of non-contractual performance. The focus of the reasonable endeavours inquiry is clear: what steps can reasonably be taken to ensure contractual performance. The limits to that inquiry are also clear; they are provided by the contract. By contrast, RTI’s case is not anchored to the contract. It begs a number of questions and gives rise to considerable legal and factual uncertainty. In particular, it requires inquiries into whether the acceptance of non-contractual performance would: (i) involve no detriment or other prejudice to the party seeking to invoke force majeure, and (ii) achieve the same result as performance of the contractual obligation in question. There is no justification for creating needless additional uncertainty by departing from the standard of performance provided by the terms of the contract [48] – [49], [57]. Additionally, the authorities relied on by MUR provide strong support for its case. First, there is Bulman & Dickson v Fenwick and Company [1894] 1 Q.B. 179 which concerned a reasonable endeavours proviso in an exceptions clause. Although the case did not deal with an offer of non-contractual performance by the other party, it supports the view that a reasonable endeavours qualification in respect of an exceptions clause does not require the affected party to give up its contractual right (including by exercising an option in the contract) even if it would be reasonable to do so. Secondly, there is the Vancouver Strikes case [1963] AC 691. In that case charterers were able to rely on an exceptions clause to excuse a delay in their performance due to a strike, even though they had not exercised a contractual option which would have enabled them to avoid the delay. The charterers were not obliged to exercise the option, even if it would have been reasonable to do so [60], [64], [74]. The facts of this case are stronger than in the Vancouver Strikes case. There was no option for MUR to accept payment in Euros. Had there been, the Vancouver Strikes case indicates that MUR would still have been entitled not to exercise that option and to insist on payment in dollars [75]. The various cases relied upon by RTI are distinguishable and do not provide support for its case. [76] – [101]. For these reasons, the Supreme Court allows MUR’s appeal [103].			
2024	uksc-2022-0183	Centrica Overseas Holdings Ltd (Appellant) v Commissioners for His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (Respondent)	This appeal concerns section 1219 of the Corporation Tax Act 2009 ("the 2009 Act") which enables a company with investment business to deduct the expenses of management of that business in calculating its profits for the purpose of calculating corporation tax. However, by section 1219(3)(a) of the 2009 Act, expenses of management cannot be deducted if they constitute capital expenditure. The appellant (“COHL”) is an investment holding company in the Centrica Plc group. Its principal activity is holding capital investments for the purpose of long-term investment from which it derives value, and significantly, its business is to manage its capital assets, not to trade with them. The question in the appeal is whether professional advisory fees incurred by COHL, which are accepted to have been expenses of management, were revenue expenditure and therefore deductible, or capital expenditure and therefore not deductible by virtue of section 1219(3)(a) of the 2009 Act. In July 2005, COHL acquired a Dutch company, Oxxio BV ("Oxxio"), with four subsidiaries. The investment in Oxxio proved unsuccessful and generated significant losses. In June or July 2009, Centrica Plc resolved to sell Oxxio and took immediate steps to achieve that aim, including instructing professional advisers. In March 2011, following a lengthy process, the assets of two of the Oxxio subsidiaries and the shares in a third subsidiary were sold by COHL. Between July 2009 and March 2011, COHL paid professional fees in connection with the sale of Oxxio to Deutsche Bank AG London, PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) and De Brauw, which totalled £2,529,697 (the "Disputed Expenditure"). COHL claimed relief for the Disputed Expenditure in its tax return for the accounting period ending 31 December 2011. However, HMRC denied the claim on the basis that the Disputed Expenditure was not deductible because it was not an expense of management and, even if it was, it was capital in nature. COHL appealed to the First-tier Tribunal ("FTT"), which found that most (but not all) of the Disputed Expenditure was expenses of management, but dismissed the appeal on the basis that the Disputed Expenditure was not incurred by COHL. In respect of the capital expenditure question, the FTT found that some of the Disputed Expenditure was revenue expenditure and would have been deductible, and some capital expenditure and not deductible. COHL appealed to the Upper Tribunal, which allowed the appeal, finding that all of the Disputed Expenditure was both expenses of management of COHL and revenue expenditure, and therefore deductible. HMRC appealed to the Court of Appeal, which found that the Disputed Expenditure was expenses of management, but allowed HMRC's appeal on the basis that the Disputed Expenditure was capital in nature and therefore not deductible. It is now agreed that the Disputed Expenditure was expenses of management, and COHL appeals to the Supreme Court only on the question whether the Disputed Expenditure was capital in nature.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses COHL’s appeal. It holds that the Disputed Expenditure was capital in nature, and therefore not deductible under section 1219(3)(a) of the 2009 Act. Lady Simler gives the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.	As an investment business, COHL is entitled to deduct expenses of management under section 1219(1) of the 2009 Act when calculating its total profits to calculate its liability to corporation tax. However, expenses of a capital nature may not be deducted as they are excluded by section 1219(3)(a) of the 2009 Act. This is similar to the position of ordinary trading companies which cannot deduct expenses of a capital nature in calculating their profits: see section 53(1) of the 2009 Act. [12]-[16], [19]. COHL argues that as a matter of statutory interpretation, the words “expenses of a capital nature” in section 1219(3)(a) of the 2009 Act have a more limited meaning than the similar phrase in section 53(1), and were intended only to exclude the acquisition costs of investments themselves (together with expenditure not separable from those costs) and a limited category of fixed capital costs such as buildings. The Supreme Court disagrees. The words of section 1219(3)(a) are clear and straightforward, as is their statutory context. The words “expenses of a capital nature” in s1219(3)(a) and “items of a capital nature” in section 53(1) must mean the same thing. Both were intended to carve out expenses which are capital in nature by reference to the concept of expenditure of a capital nature already well-established in the tax code and the case law [51]-[52]. Parliament can be taken to have been aware of the established capital/revenue case law when it first legislated to introduce the capital bar in 2004, by section 38 of the Finance Act 2004. It would be surprising if the exclusion for capital expenditure was intended to have a special narrower meaning without anything to signal that this was so. The supporting material, legislative history and timing of the introduction of the capital exclusion all demonstrate an intention in the legislation to align the trading company and investment company rules in relation to capital expenditure. The same legislative purpose is readily inferred from the fact that the capital exclusion was re-enacted in section 1219(3)(a) of the 2009 Act using the same words “of a capital nature” as those found in section 53(1) of the 2009 Act without any limit or qualification signalling a contrary intention. Section 1219(3)(a) is to be interpreted in accordance with well-established capital/revenue principles accordingly [53]-[55], [61]. The question whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature is a question of law. The previously decided cases reflect the fact that items of expenditure on the borderline can be difficult to assign between these two broad categories. There is no single test that can be applied to decide which items are capital expenditure and which are revenue in every case. Rather, much depends on the circumstances. Nonetheless, the capital/revenue case law is useful in providing illustrations of the approach adopted and of the factors regarded as relevant in a particular set of circumstances. The principles derived from the cases are useful, provided it is recognised that they cannot automatically be applied to a different fact pattern or circumstance [62]-[64]. A good starting point is to identify the purpose for which the payment is made; in other words, what the money is being spent on. This must be assessed objectively, and not according to the subjective motive or purpose of the taxpayer. There are cases, particularly those involving trading companies, where difficulties can arise in determining on which side of the revenue/capital line the expenditure in question falls. In these cases, a helpful starting point is to identify whether some form of asset has been obtained. However, there is no such difficulty in this appeal: whereas the investments of an investment dealing company are revenue assets (or circulating capital) with which it trades, the investments of a holding company are capital assets (or fixed capital), and its business is to manage those assets. COHL’s investments are capital assets, and this includes its investment in Oxxio. Where a capital asset is identified, it can generally be assumed that money spent on the acquisition or disposal of the asset should be regarded as capital expenditure [65]-[67], [70]-[71], [75]. Applying these principles to the facts found by the FTT, the Disputed Expenditure was incurred on professional and advisory services and was expenses of management. Fees for such services are capable of being either revenue or capital in nature. Such fees take their character from the commercial or business transaction for which they are incurred. Here, Oxxio was an onerous capital asset. The transaction achieved in substance the disposal of this loss-making investment from the Centrica group. Looked at objectively, once a commercial decision was taken to dispose of the Oxxio business, the services of Deutsche Bank, PwC and De Brauw were obtained to enable management to achieve that disposal. The Disputed Expenditure was both directed at and focused on bringing about the disposal, in whatever form that transaction ultimately took. Since money expended to achieve the disposal of a capital asset is properly regarded as being of a capital nature, the Disputed Expenditure was capital in nature. It was not therefore deductible as an expense of management for corporation tax purposes [80]-[83], [87], [89]-[90].			
2024	uksc-2023-0025	Hassam and another (Appellants) v Rabot and another (Respondents)	Although the sums at stake in the two test cases in this appeal are small, it is clear that many thousands of cases are potentially affected by this decision. Statutory reforms were made by the Civil Liability Act 2018 (“the 2018 Act”) to claims for whiplash injuries (“WLI”) caused by negligent driving. The question at issue on this appeal is how should damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity (“PSLA”) be assessed, where that PSLA was caused by both a WLI and a non-whiplash injury (“NWLI”) suffered in the same road traffic accident? Generally, claims for PSLA damages in the tort of negligence (a form of civil wrong) are determined by applying common law principles. Where there are multiple injuries, a judge assesses the damages for PSLA caused by each separate injury by reference to well-established guidelines, before “stepping back” to look at the total PSLA for all injuries. The judge may then adjust the total to avoid over- or under-compensating the claimant. However, when Parliament passed the 2018 Act the approach to WLI claims was changed significantly. The amount to be awarded for PSLA for a WLI was fixed by regulations at a “tariff amount”, that varies only by reason of the duration of the WLI and is significantly lower than the damages that would be awarded for WLIs at common law. The two claimants in this appeal, Mr Rabot and Mr Briggs, were injured in separate car accidents caused by the negligence of other drivers (the defendants). Both claimants suffered WLIs and NWLIs which caused them PSLA. District Judge Hennessy heard both cases. In Mr Rabot’s case, the District Judge assessed the tariff amount for the WLI at £1,390 and the NWLI damages, assessed at common law, at £2,500, producing an initial total of £3,890. As Mr Rabot’s PSLA was concurrently caused by the WLIs and NWLIs, the District Judge stepped back and reduced Mr Rabot’s total damages to £3,100. Mr Briggs’ tariff amount was assessed at £840 with NWLI damages at £3,000, producing an initial total of £3,840. Again, the PSLA was caused concurrently by WLIs and NWLIs. The District Judge reduced Mr Briggs’ total damages to £2,800. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that any PSLA caused by both WLIs and NWLIs was already compensated for in the tariff amount, so that only PSLA caused exclusively by NWLIs could be compensated for in addition to the tariff amount. This was referred to as the “first approach”. The claimants cross-appealed, arguing that the tariff amount and the PSLA damages for the NWLI should have simply been added together without any deduction for overlap. This was referred to as the “second approach”. By a majority, the Court of Appeal found that the District Judge’s approach, in adding the tariff amount and NWLI PSLA damages together and then reducing the latter to avoid over-compensation for concurrently caused PSLA, was correct (although the overall award to Mr Briggs was increased to £3,500). This was referred to as the “third approach”. The Master of the Rolls (in his dissenting judgment) endorsed the first approach. The defendants now appeal, and the claimants cross-appeal, to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeals and the cross-appeals. The majority of the Court of Appeal took the right approach (as essentially did the District Judge) in assessing damages for PSLA concurrently caused by WLIs and NWLIs. Lord Burrows gives the sole judgment, with which Lord Reed, Lord Lloyd-Jones, Lord Hamblen and Lady Rose agree.	The third approach is correct. The correct interpretation of both the statutory wording and the underlying purpose of the 2018 Act is that the legislation was directed specifically towards the damages available for WLI (not NWLI) claims. The 2018 Act does not, therefore limit the PSLA damages recoverable at common law for NWLI. [9], [37] – [43]. The first approach was rejected for four main reasons. First, there is nothing in the 2018 Act or accompanying materials to suggest that NWLI damages fell within the scope of the reforms. Second, the first approach requires an unrealistic level of precision from claimants in distinguishing NWLI-only from concurrently caused PSLA. This would increase the costs and complexity of these claims, contrary to the objective of the reforms as a whole. Third, it could have the bizarre result in claimants receiving lower PSLA damages for both WLIs and NWLIs than they would if they claimed just for a NWLI. Fourth, it would be a more significant departure from the common law than the third approach; conflicting with the presumption that legislation affects common law as minimally as possible. [7], [43] – [48]. The second approach is rejected because it ignores the issue of overcompensation. The common law adjustment ensures that the claimant is not compensated twice for the same PSLA. The tariff amount dictates the appropriate compensation for PSLA caused by a WLI and the whiplash reforms would be undermined if overlapping PSLA was ignored. [6], [10] – [18], [43], [49] – [50]. Lord Burrows then summarised, step by step, the correct third approach. Where a claimant seeks damages for a WLI and NWLI, a judge should: (i) assess the tariff amount for the WLI; (ii) assess the common law damages for the NWLI; (iii) add these amounts together; (iv) step back and consider whether an adjustment to the total to avoid over- or under-compensation for concurrently caused PSLA is appropriate; (v) make any such adjustment to the common law damages (not the tariff amount, which is fixed); but (vi) ensure that the total damages award is not lower than would have been awarded as common law damages for the NWLI if the claimant had made no WLI claim. [51].			
2024	uksc-2023-0028	Davies (Respondent) v Bridgend County Borough Council (Appellant)	This appeal concerns the tort of private nuisance (i.e. a civil wrong which involves undue interference with the enjoyment or use of another person’s land). In this case the nuisance arises from the encroachment of ‘Japanese knotweed’. At some date well before Mr Davies (“the claimant”) purchased his land in Bridgend in 2004, Japanese knotweed spread from land owned by Bridgend County Borough Council (“the defendant”) onto the land now owned by the claimant. In 2004, encroachment of Japanese knotweed onto neighbouring land was not an actionable private nuisance. An actionable private nuisance arose in 2013 when the defendant was, or ought to have been, aware of the risk of damage and loss of amenity to the claimant’s land as a result of publicly available information about Japanese knotweed at the time, and it failed to implement a reasonable and effective treatment programme in relation to Japanese knotweed which it knew or ought to have known was growing on its land. It was not until 2018 that the defendant implemented a reasonable and effective treatment programme. The claimant brought a claim for damages against the defendant in Swansea County Court. The district judge found that the defendant was in continuing breach between 2013 and 2018 but declined to award damages because he held that damages for diminution in value are irrecoverable. On a first appeal, the district judge’s ruling was upheld. On a further appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the finding of continuing breach but found that damages for residual diminution of the value of the claimant’s land (said to be £4,900) were recoverable. The defendant now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. The diminution in value of the claimant’s land was not caused by the defendant’s tortious conduct, and no damages should be awarded. Lord Stephens gives the lead judgment, with which the other Justices agree. Lord Burrows gives a concurring judgment.	In the tort of private nuisance involving encroachment of Japanese knotweed from the defendant’s land onto the claimant’s land, the claimant is required to establish that the defendant’s breach of duty did in fact cause the loss suffered [56]. In considering causation the purpose of the “but for” test is to eliminate irrelevant causative factors [56]. In the context of this case the “but for” test asks: would the diminution in value of which the claimant complains have occurred “but for” the breach of duty of the defendant between 2013 and 2018? If the diminution in value would have occurred in any event, then the defendant’s breach of duty is eliminated as a cause of the diminution in value so that there would be no causal link between the defendant’s breach of duty and the diminution in value [56]. The answer to the “but for” question in this case is to be seen in the context that there was no evidence and no finding by the district judge that the defendant’s breach of duty between 2013 and 2018 had increased or materially contributed to the diminution in value of the claimant’s land [70]. In that context the answer to the “but for” question is simply that the diminution in value had occurred long before any breach by the defendant of the relevant duty in private nuisance first occurred in 2013 [70]. Accordingly, the application of the “but for” test in this case eliminates the defendant’s subsequent breach of duty as a causative factor [70]. The diminution in value would have occurred in any event so that there is no causal link between the defendant’s breach of duty and the diminution in value claimed [70]. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed on this ground so that no damages are awarded. The claimant raised a further issue before the Supreme Court that he should be entitled to recover damages in respect of diminution in value because the stigma causing the diminution decreases over time with the consequence that the amount of diminution in value also decreases over time. The claimant asserted that if the defendant had commenced treatment of the Japanese Knotweed in 2013 instead of in 2018 then the stigma and the resultant amount of diminution in value would have decreased by 2018. Accordingly, an award should be made for the difference between the amount of diminution in value in 2018 and the amount that it would have been in 2018 if treatment had commenced in 2013 [9]. He argued that in the absence of evidence from the defendant demonstrating what the lower figure should be awarded, he should recover the full amount of £4,900 in respect of the diminution in value [9]. This issue was not pleaded, there was no evidence to support it and in any event the onus remained on the claimant to establish the difference between the diminution sum had the Japanese knotweed been treated in 2013 and the actual sum in 2018 [72]. Accordingly, this submission was rejected [73]. Lord Burrows agrees with the majority’s reasoning and conclusion and adds some remarks regarding factual causation [75]-[87]. The question to be answered in this case is whether the relevant damage required to establish the tort of private nuisance was factually caused by the breach of duty where the same damage was present prior to the breach of duty [79]. Applying the “but for” test to the facts of this case, the breach of duty from 2013 did not factually cause the residual diminution in value of the land [85]. The claimant has not proved that the residual diminution in value would not have been suffered but for the breach of duty [85]. This was because the Japanese knotweed was already present on the claimant’s land before 2013 so that the residual diminution in value had already been brought about by the natural, non-actionable, encroachment of the Japanese knotweed [85].			
2024	uksc-2023-0029	Sharp Corp Ltd (Respondent) v Viterra BV (previously known as Glencore Agriculture BV) (Appellant)	Viterra BV (“the Sellers”) and Sharp Corporation Limited (“the Buyers”) entered into two Cost & Freight free out (“C&FFO”) Mundra sales contracts dated 20 January 2017 for the sale of lentils (“the Lentils Contract”) and the sale of peas (“the Peas Contract” collectively, “the contracts”). The contracts were identical save as to commodity, quantity and price. The contracts provided that all terms and conditions not conflicting with the express terms of the contracts should be as the Grain and Free Trade Association (“GAFTA”) Contract No 24. On 26 April 2017, the Sellers nominated the vessel RB Leah (“the Vessel”) under both contracts. On 10 May 2017, a total quantity of 21,000 mt of lentils and 47,250 mt of peas was loaded on board the Vessel in Vancouver. The Buyers did not pay for the goods within 5 days prior to the Vessel’s arrival at Mundra as required under the contracts. On 8 November 2017, the Government of India imposed an import tariff on yellow peas of 50% with immediate effect. On 21 December 2017, the Government of India imposed a tariff of 30.9% on lentils with immediate effect. By a contract dated 7 February 2018, the Sellers re-sold the peas to their associated company Agricore Commodities Ltd (“Agricore”) for US$378 per mt. By a contract dated 9 February 2018, the Sellers re-sold the lentils to Agricore for US$431 per mt. The Sellers declared the Buyers in default and commenced arbitration seeking damages. The Appeal Board, in two amended awards dated 1 April 2021 (awards No. 4580A and 4581A, collectively, "the Awards") found that the Buyers were in default by their failure to pay for the goods in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contracts, and liable to pay damages based on the estimated value of the goods on the date of default which they assessed by reference to the theoretical cost on the date of default of (i) buying those goods free on board (“FOB”) at the original port of shipment plus (ii) the market freight rate for transporting the goods from that port to the discharge port free out. The damages awarded to the Sellers were US$ 4,163,250 under the Lentils Contract and US$ 903,750 under the Peas Contract. The Buyers appealed the decision on damages pursuant to section 69 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (“the Act”) and by an order dated 13 May 2021, Jacobs J granted the Buyers permission to appeal. On appeal, Cockerill J dismissed the Buyers’ appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal but did so in relation to a question of law which it had amended. It also held that damages should be awarded on the basis that the contracts had been varied, as to which there was no finding by the Appeal Board. The Sellers now appeal to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the Court of Appeal exceeded its jurisdiction. The Buyers cross-appeal on the basis that, if the appeal succeeds, damages should be awarded on an “as is, where is” basis, being the estimated ex warehouse Mundra value of the goods.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal but allows the cross appeal. The Awards are remitted to the Appeal Board for reconsideration. Lord Hamblen gives the judgment with which all the other Justices agree.	The appeal: Issue 1: did the Court of Appeal err in amending the question of law for which permission to appeal had been given? The question of law for which permission was given asked how “the actual or estimated value of the goods, on the date of default” under sub-clause (c) of the GAFTA Default Clause are to be assessed “where goods sold C&F free out are located at their discharge port on the date of the buyer’s default”. The Court of Appeal amended the question of law by adding “in the circumstances found by the Appeal Board in the Awards”. Amendments to the question of law are permissible provided that “the substance of the question of law remains the same”, as set out in Cottonex Anstalt v Patriot Spinning Mills Ltd [2014] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 615 [55]. In this case, the question was framed in abstract terms and the effect of the amendment is to tie that generally expressed question to the facts found in the Awards. That is a permissible amendment. The amendment was expressly stating what is implicit in any arbitration appeal. It did not change the substance of the question of law [57]. Issue 2: did the Court of Appeal err in deciding a question of law which the Appeal Board were not asked to determine and on which it did not make a decision? Section 69(1) of the Act sets out that a party may appeal on a “question of law arising out of an award” and that the question must be one which the “tribunal was asked to determine” (section 69(3)(b)) [51]. This requires that the point of law be fairly and squarely before the tribunal for determination – see Safeway Stores v Legal and General Assurance Society Ltd [2004] EWHC 415 (Ch), [2005] 1 P&CR 9. In determining the appeal, the Court of Appeal decided that the value of the goods was to be measured by reference to a notional sale of the goods in bulk ex warehouse Mundra on 2 February 2018, on instalment payment terms. This decision was founded on the conclusion that the contracts had been varied [64]. The question of whether and, if so, how the contracts had been varied was neither argued before nor addressed by the Appeal Board [68]. It follows that this is not a question of law for which permission to appeal could be given under section 69 of the Act and, if so, it is not open to the Court of Appeal to introduce such a question on an appeal [69]. Issue 3: did the Court of Appeal err in making findings of fact on matters on which the Appeal Board had made no finding? The Sellers contend that the Court of Appeal impermissibly made findings of fact, in particular a finding that the cargo had been discharged from the Vessel against presentation of the original bills of lading to the Vessel’s agent [76]. The court’s jurisdiction under the Act is limited to appeals on a question of law. It has no jurisdiction to make its own findings of fact. [71]. Whilst there may be circumstances where it is possible to infer that the tribunal has made a finding of fact even though it is not expressly set out in the award [72], these circumstances are limited. It is necessary to show that the inferred finding is one which inevitably follows from the findings which have been made [74]. The finding that discharge was made against presentation of the original bills of lading is a finding of fact. It was not relevant to any issue addressed by the Appeal Board and it by no means inevitably follows from the findings which were made [77]. This finding was central to the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the contracts had been varied. It follows that Court of Appeal erred in making that finding [79]. The cross-appeal: Damages fall to be assessed under clause 25 of the GAFTA Contract (“the Default Clause”). This clause reflects both the compensatory principle and the principle of mitigation of damages [83-87]. In accordance with the principle of mitigation, if a substitute sale or purchase is reasonably made then that is likely to be the default price. If, however, there is no such substitute transaction, or none that it is appropriate to rely upon (as in this case where it was with an affiliated company), then damages are assessed under cl 25(c) on the basis of “the actual or estimated value of the goods, on the date of default”. Sub-clause (c) “covers the same territory” as sections 50(3) and 51(3), of the Sale of Goods Act and the common law, which means that where there is an available market the normal or prima facie means of establishing the “actual or estimated value of the goods” under sub-clause (c) is by reference to the price of a substitute sale or purchase in that market. [97]. In the present case, there was no evidence before the Appeal Board of an available market for a substitute transaction on C&FFO Mundra terms and the issue which then arises is by reference to what market is the estimated value of the goods to be established. The Sellers contend that it should be the FOB Vancouver market with appropriate adjustments being made to arrive at a C&FFO Mundra price, as the Appeal Board accepted. The Buyers contend that it should be the ex warehouse Mundra market [99]. The proper approach is to be guided by the principle of mitigation and to consider the market in which it would be reasonable for the Sellers to sell the goods. On the date of default the Sellers were left with goods, which were landed, customs cleared and stored in a warehouse. The goods had also significantly increased in value because of the imposition of customs tariffs. In such circumstances, the obvious market in which to sell the goods, and in which it would clearly be reasonable to do so was the ex warehouse Mundra market [100]. This approach is supported by the following considerations: (i) the common law approach to damages for non-acceptance in CIF contracts: (ii) where goods are left in the seller’s hands the question is what reasonable steps should be taken to sell those goods; (iii) it means that sub-clauses (a) and (c) are interpreted and applied in a consistent manner; (iv) it is consistent with the compensatory principle and brings the benefit of the increased value of the goods in the Sellers’ hands as a result of the imposition of import tariffs into account, and (v) it is consistent with the findings made by the Appeal Board relating to other aspects of damages [102-115]. It follows that the Appeal Board erred in law in its assessment of damages. The answer to the question of law is that the value of the goods under paragraph (c) of the Default Clause falls to be measured by reference to a notional sale of the goods in bulk ex warehouse Mundra on 2 February 2018 [121].			
2023	uksc-2018-0191-0192	The Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc (Respondent) v Ukraine (represented by the Minister of Finance of Ukraine acting upon the instructions of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine) (Appellant)	This appeal arises out of a contractual dispute between Ukraine and the Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc ("the Trustee"), acting on behalf of the Russian Federation ("Russia"). In 2013, Ukraine issued Eurobonds ("the Notes") with a nominal value of US $3 billion and carrying interest at 5% per annum to Russia, and Russia paid the subscription money to Ukraine. In substance this amounted to a loan of the $3 billion by Russia to Ukraine, repayable in December 2015. The Trustee is the trustee of the Notes, which were constituted by a trust deed. The Trustee and Ukraine chose to have the trust deed governed by the law of England and Wales and specified that the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction to hear any disputes arising out of it. The trust deed and related contractual documents were entered into by Ukraine represented by its Minister of Finance, acting on the instructions of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine ("the CMU"). Ukraine maintains that it undertook the transaction following massive economic and political pressure from Russia to induce Ukraine not to enter into an association agreement with the European Union and to accept Russian financial support instead, in the form of the Notes. That pressure is alleged to have been unlawful under international law and in any event illegitimate. Shortly afterwards, Russia invaded Crimea and purported to annex it. Ukraine contends that Russia has since interfered militarily and succeeded in destabilising and causing huge destruction across eastern Ukraine. The Supreme Court heard the appeal before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has not been asked to consider the invasion or events which have followed. Ukraine initially made some payments under the Notes, but it failed to repay them when they matured on 21 December 2015. The Trustee therefore issued proceedings against Ukraine, claiming the sums due to Russia. Ukraine filed a defence, which alleged (among other things) that, first, Ukraine lacked capacity to enter into the transaction by which the Notes were issued as a matter of Ukrainian law. Secondly, the Minister of Finance lacked authority to enter into the transaction. Thirdly, Ukraine was entitled to avoid the Notes because of duress arising from Russia's unlawful and illegitimate threats and pressure, including restrictive trade measures and threats to Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence. Fourthly, Ukraine was entitled to rely on the public international law doctrine of countermeasures to decline to make payment under the Notes. The Trustee applied for summary judgment, a procedure which enables the court to decide a claim without a trial where the defence has no real prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason for a trial. The trial judge granted the application. He decided the claim in the Trustee’s favour without a trial and ordered Ukraine to pay the sums due under the Notes. On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's conclusions on the issues of capacity, authority and countermeasures, but held that the claim could not be decided without a trial because Ukraine had an arguable and justiciable defence of duress.	The Supreme Court unanimously holds that the Trustee is not entitled to summary judgment. This means that Ukraine will be permitted to defend the claim for the sums due under the Notes at trial before the High Court. Lord Reed, Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lord Kitchin give the majority judgment, with which Lord Hodge agrees. They hold that Ukraine should be permitted to defend the claim on the ground of duress, but only to the extent that it is based on duress of the person or of goods resulting from Russia's alleged threatened use of force. Ukraine's defences on the issues of capacity, authority and countermeasures should be struck out. Lord Carnwath gives a judgment in which he agrees with the majority on the issues of capacity and authority. However, he would have allowed the defence of duress to proceed to trial on a broader basis than the majority. He also considers that the countermeasures defence should be permitted to proceed.	Issue 1: Did Ukraine have the capacity to issue the Notes or to enter into the related contracts?  The Supreme Court holds that, as a sovereign state which is recognised as such by the UK government, Ukraine is a legal person with full capacity in English law [20]-[26]. It is not therefore arguable that it lacked the capacity to issue the Notes or to enter into the related contracts [34]. The Court rejects Ukraine's submission that it lacked capacity because its ability to enter into contracts was limited by its constitution and Ukrainian domestic law. It finds that the capacity of a sovereign state in English law cannot be restricted in this way because it derives from the state's recognition by the UK government, not from the state's internal law [29]. The Court's recognition of Ukraine as a legal person with full capacity is a reflection of its sovereignty and independence. It therefore fully accords with and promotes the principle of international comity [33].  Issue 2: Were the Notes issued or the related contracts entered into without authority?  The Supreme Court holds that Ukraine's Minister of Finance had ostensible (apparent) authority to sign the trust deed and related contractual documents and to issue the Notes, on behalf of Ukraine. The CMU had ostensible authority to pass a resolution authorising the Minister of Finance to proceed with the transaction [116]. The events leading up to the issuance of the Notes, which involved the President of Ukraine, the CMU and the Minister of Finance, demonstrated to the Trustee a co-ordinated and consistent approach to the borrowing [77]-[81]. If a state represents that a person has authority to act on its behalf, it will be bound by the acts of that person with respect to anyone dealing with him as an agent on the faith of that representation [82]-[90].  The Trustee was not put on inquiry (notice) that the Minister of Finance might not have actual authority as the issue of the Notes would breach the external borrowing limits imposed by Ukrainian law [91]-[113]. The Trustee should not be taken to have known of the existence and meaning of this alleged limit [95]-[101]. The Trustee understood and had no reason to doubt that the Minister of Finance was authorised to issue the Notes, and it was on this basis that the Trustee was content to proceed [114]-[115].  Issue 3: Can Ukraine maintain that it was entitled to avoid the Notes for duress exerted by Russia?  The majority of the Supreme Court holds that, when a party's consent to a contract is induced by threats or pressure, the contract is voidable by the aggrieved party provided that: (i) the threat or pressure was illegitimate under English law; and (ii) there is a sufficient causal connection between the threat or pressure and the aggrieved party's decision to enter into the contract [142]-[144]. Ukraine's allegations in relation to duress concern two different kinds of pressure which are treated differently in English law [145]-[148].  The first category comprises economic pressure, including Russia's alleged imposition and threat of trade restrictions. Trade sanctions, embargoes and protectionism are normal aspects of statecraft. They cannot be regarded as inherently illegitimate or contrary to public policy. Accordingly, the economic pressure alleged by Ukraine does not constitute duress under English law and cannot, in itself, establish a defence to the Trustee's claim. It is unnecessary to consider whether the economic pressure was applied by Russia in breach of international law, as the applicable test is whether the pressure was illegitimate under English law [149]-[170].  The second category comprises Russia's alleged threats to use force to destroy Ukraine's security and territorial integrity. These threats may constitute duress of the person, because they would almost inevitably involve the use of violence against Ukrainian armed forces and civilians. They may also constitute duress of goods, because they are likely to result in the destruction of or damage to property in Ukraine. Duress of the person and duress of goods are clear examples of illegitimate pressure. Accordingly, the success of Ukraine's defence turns on whether Russia's threatened use of force imposed what English law regards as illegitimate pressure on Ukraine to enter into the trust deed and related contracts. That question can only be determined after trial [171]-[183]. It is justiciable because the court can answer it without determining the validity or lawfulness of Russia's acts under international or domestic law [184]-[193].  It will be necessary to consider the causal connection between Russia's alleged threats of force and Ukraine's decision to enter into the transaction at trial. The onus will be on the Trustee to prove that the threats of force (if established) did not contribute to Ukraine's decision. The economic pressure will be relevant as part of the factual context. If it is found to have accentuated the impact of the threats of force, this will strengthen Ukraine’s case [196].  Dissenting on this issue, Lord Carnwath would allow Ukraine's defence of duress to proceed to trial as pleaded. He holds that it is unnecessary to separate the economic from the physical threats, which were parts of a single concerted course of action. He also disagrees with the majority's view that the international legal standards which govern the relationship between sovereign states are irrelevant to the question of whether the conduct of one state towards another is illegitimate for the purposes of duress under English law [217]-[221].  Issue 4: Can Ukraine maintain that non-payment of the sums due under the Notes is a lawful countermeasure?  The majority holds that Ukraine's case on countermeasures is irrelevant to the determination of the rights and duties arising under English law in relation to the Notes [207]. The application by English courts of rules of international law is clearly restricted by domestic constitutional principles, including the principle of non-justiciability [204]. The principles of international law governing the rights of states to take countermeasures are generally not justiciable before courts in this jurisdiction for two reasons: first, English law does not recognise a defence reflecting the availability of countermeasures on the international level and secondly, the subject matter of such inter-state disputes is inherently unsuitable for adjudication by courts in this jurisdiction. It is not the function of national courts to arbitrate inter-state disputes arising on the international level and governed by international law. While the second objection may be subject to exceptions founded on domestic public policy, it was not necessary to address that issue because the first objection is a complete answer [207]. Accordingly, Ukraine has no arguable defence in these proceedings based on any right it may have in international law to take countermeasures on the international level [208].  Dissenting on this issue, Lord Carnwath would have allowed the defence of countermeasures to proceed to trial. In his view, the criteria for availability of the defence of countermeasures in international law are satisfied [224]-[225]. The principle of non-justiciability may be departed from in this wholly exceptional case, between in effect two sovereign states, and in response to a clear breach of fundamental principles of international law to which both parties are subject. Ukraine alleges that this is one such exceptional case, and Lord Carnwath would have permitted the matter to be tested at trial [227].			
2023	uksc-2019-0204	Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and another (Appellants/Cross-Respondents) v Agnew and others (Respondents/Cross-Appellants) (Northern Ireland)	This appeal concerns the entitlement of police officers and civilian staff in Northern Ireland to recover sums which their employer should have paid to them as holiday pay when they took paid annual leave. The Respondents are lead claimants selected from 3,380 police constables and 364 civilian employees of the Police Service of Northern Ireland who have brought claims relating to underpaid holiday pay against their employer. The Appellants, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Policing Board, accept that the Respondents were underpaid but dispute the period for which the Respondents are entitled to recover. The relevant legislation is the Working Time Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1998 and 2016 (together, “the WTRs (NI)”) and the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (“the ERO”). The WTRs (NI) implemented the EU Working Time Directives 1993 and 2003 in Northern Ireland (“the WTDs”). These required Member States to ensure that every worker is entitled to at least four weeks’ paid annual leave. The view for many years was that holiday pay should be equivalent to a worker’s “basic pay”. However, it has since been established that holiday pay should be calculated by reference to a worker’s “normal pay”, and this should include an element to reflect the overtime that the worker usually works. The Respondents, who were only paid their basic pay as holiday pay but who regularly worked overtime, now seek to recover the amount by which they were underpaid. The Appellants rely on a provision in the WTRs (NI) that would restrict the police officer Respondents to recovering sums underpaid in the three months before their claims were brought before the Industrial Tribunal. The Respondents rely on an alternative provision in the ERO which would allow them to claim underpayments arising from a series of payments, provided that the last underpayment in the series was not more than three months before the claim was brought before the Industrial Tribunal (“the Series Extension”). The Respondents brought a claim before the Industrial Tribunal, which held that all the Respondents could rely on the Series Extension and that most if not all the payments were in a series for that purpose. The Appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal which dismissed the appeal as regards the issues which are the subject of the present appeal. The Appellants now appeal to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the Appellants’ appeal. Lord Kitchin and Lady Rose give a joint judgment with which the other members of the Court agree.	The statutory provisions There are two statutory routes through which a worker can bring a claim relating to underpaid holiday pay. First, the WTRs (NI) provide that a worker may bring a complaint before an Industrial Tribunal that an employer has failed to pay statutory holiday pay [31]. A complaint brought under the WTRs (NI) can ordinarily only extend back three months from the date of claim [33]. Second, the ERO confers a right on workers not to have unauthorised deductions made from their wages [35]-[36]. “Wages” are defined to include holiday pay. The ERO provisions regarding limitation are more favourable to a claimant and include the Series Extension [38]. The Appellants accept that the civilian staff Respondents can bring a claim under the ERO but contend that the police officer Respondents cannot because they are not employees or workers for the purposes of the ERO, although the rights under the WTRs (NI) are expressly extended to them [37]. Can the police officer Respondents rely on the Series Extension when bringing their claim for unpaid holiday pay before the Industrial Tribunal? The EU principle of equivalence requires that national procedural rules applicable to EU rights must not be less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions [50]-[57]. The police officer Respondents argue that the principle of equivalence applies in this case: the remedy under the ERO is more advantageous than the remedy they have to enforce their EU-derived right to four weeks’ paid leave under the WTRs (NI) [38]. The Supreme Court holds that the EU principle of equivalence is infringed by the inability of claimants under the WTRs (NI) to benefit from the Series Extension available to claimants under the ERO [78]. The Court of Appeal was right to determine that the objective, purpose and essential characteristics of the ERO and WTRs (NI) are so similar that they should be regarded as similar domestic proceedings [59]-[61]. When considering whether a claimant should be able to rely on the procedural rules applicable to a comparable action, there is no requirement that the claimant must be within the class of people who could bring a claim under that comparable provision [67]. The appropriate remedy for the breach is to construe the WTRs (NI) so that they comply with the EU principle by reading the Series Extension into the relevant part of the WTRs (NI) such that all the Respondents can rely on it [75]. What is the scope and meaning of the Series Extension? The purpose of the ERO provisions regarding unlawful deductions is to protect workers, some of whom may be vulnerable, from being paid too little for the work they do [87], [112]. The Series Extension provides protection against the operation of the short limitation period for a worker who suffers repeated deductions from their wages such that they are paid too little on a series of occasions [90], [117]. What constitutes a series is a question of fact that must be answered in light of all relevant circumstances [127]. The Court of Appeal was right to find that each unlawful underpayment was linked by the common fault that holiday pay had been calculated by reference to basic pay only [130]. A series does not require a contiguous sequence of deductions and a gap of more than three months between deductions does not necessarily bring a series to an end [117]-[125], [128]. A correct payment of holiday pay does not break a series if that correct payment was calculated by reference to basic pay [130]. Remaining Issues There is no legal requirement that leave derived from different sources must be taken in a particular order [132]-[138]. It is inappropriate to use the number of calendar days in the reference period when calculating a worker’s normal pay [139]-[142]. The appropriate reference period in any case is a question of fact [143].			
2023	uksc-2020-0002	RBarton and others (Respondents) v Morris and another in place of Gwyn-Jones (deceased) (Appellants) [2023] UKSC 3 On appeal from: [2019] EWCA Civ 1999	Foxpace Limited ("Foxpace"), the Fourth Respondent, owned a property known as Nash House in London. This appeal concerns an oral agreement between Foxpace and Mr Barton, the First Respondent, about Nash House. In the High Court it was held that Foxpace agreed to pay Mr Barton £1.2 million if he introduced a purchaser for Nash House who bought it for £6.5 million. The £1.2 million represented deposits and other expenses that Mr Barton had lost on two previous attempts to buy Nash House.  Mr Barton introduced to Foxpace a purchaser called Western UK (Acton) Limited ("Western"). Documents were drawn up for the sale of Nash House to Western for £6.55 million. However, it came to light that Nash House fell within an area safeguarded for the purpose of the construction of the HS2 rail link. As a result, Western acquired Nash House for £6 million plus VAT. Since the oral contract between Foxpace and Mr Barton made no provision as to what would happen if Nash House was sold for anything less than £6.5 million, Foxpace argued there was no contractual obligation to pay anything to Mr Barton. Accordingly, Mr Barton brought a claim for the reasonable value of his services.  The first instance judge held that Mr Barton was not entitled to any payment. In case he was wrong, the judge assessed a reasonable fee for Mr Barton’s services as being £435,000. The Court of Appeal allowed Mr Barton’s appeal and held that he was entitled to a reasonable fee. The Appellants now appeal to the Supreme Court.	By a majority the Supreme Court allows the appeal. Lady Rose gives the lead judgment, with which Lord Briggs and Lord Stephens agree. Lord Leggatt and Lord Burrows give separate dissenting judgments.	Foxpace could be contractually bound to pay a fee to Mr Barton in three different ways: (1) an express term; (2) a term implied on the facts; and (3) a term implied by law [11]. Alternatively, Foxpace could be obliged to pay a fee to Mr Barton under the law of unjust enrichment. The majority hold that none of these avenues leads to the conclusion that Mr Barton should be paid a fee [76];[107].  The express terms of the contract  The only obligation found by the judge was for Foxpace to pay Mr Barton £1.2 million if Nash House sold for at least £6.5 million to a purchaser whom Mr Barton had introduced. There was no express contractual term creating an obligation on Foxpace to pay Mr Barton a fee if Nash House was sold to Western for less than £6.5 million [17-18].  A term implied as a matter of fact  The majority hold that implying a term that Foxpace is contractually bound to pay Mr Barton an unspecified sum if a purchaser buys Nash House for less than £6.5 million contradicts the express terms of the contract [24-25]. It is not possible to say that there is any particular fee to which the parties would clearly have agreed, or which is so obvious that it goes without saying. Further, it is not necessary to imply such a term to give the agreement business efficacy [32];[37];[40].  A term implied as a matter of law  Section 15 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 implies a term that the party contracting with the supplier for services will pay a reasonable charge where consideration for the service is not determined by the contract. The majority hold that this section does not apply in the circumstances of this case because consideration was in fact determined by the contract and, possibly, because Mr Barton was not contractually obliged to provide a service, namely the introduction to Foxpace [41];[43].  The law also implies a term as an incident of the particular kind of contract in issue, for example in a lease for a flat in a block of flats or in an employment contract [44]. Mr Barton relied on a series of cases in which the courts have implied an entitlement to commission as an incident of informal contracts commonly entered into between sellers of property and estate agents when the property is sold to a purchaser introduced by the estate agent. The majority hold that Mr Barton’s contract is not the same as the contracts in those cases [67-68]. First, Mr Barton was not an estate agent and this was a one-off contract [69]. Second, the fee of £1.2 million was several times the reasonable fee for the introduction [71-72]. Third, the fee was calculated by reference to sums that Mr Barton had properly forfeited to Foxpace in the two earlier transactions [73-74]. The contract provided Mr Barton with an opportunity to recover those forfeited sums in certain circumstances and he took a risk that if he did not find a buyer at £6.5 million, he would not be able to recover those sums or any part of them [75-76].  The claim in unjust enrichment  The majority hold that Mr Barton’s claim in unjust enrichment also fails [106]. An obligation on Foxpace to pay any commission to Mr Barton when there has been no sale to Western for £6.5 million is at odds with what was agreed and the law of unjust enrichment cannot be relied on to circumvent the terms of a subsisting contract [103]. The benefit to Foxpace of a sale to a purchaser introduced by Mr Barton, for no reward to him, would not be unjust. This is because it was an outcome provided for by the agreement. Although the outcome may seem harsh to Mr Barton, unjust enrichment mends no-one’s bargain [107].  Dissenting judgments  Lord Leggatt and Lord Burrows dissent and would both dismiss the appeal. Lord Leggatt holds that Mr Barton was entitled to a reasonable remuneration under a term, implied by law, to pay a reasonable sum for the supply of services where no sum is fixed by the contract [111]; [125]. He holds that this entitlement to reasonable remuneration is not inconsistent with the inference that, if Nash House sold for less than £6.5 million, Foxpace would not be obliged to pay Mr Barton £1.2 million [170-177];[183];[188];[194-195]. Lord Leggatt also holds that the law of unjust enrichment does not assist Mr Barton’s claim [189].  Lord Burrows holds that there was a term implied by law into the contract that Mr Barton would be paid reasonable remuneration by Foxpace if he successfully introduced the buyer of Nash House to Foxpace [220]. He holds that the express terms of the contract, for payment of £1.2 million if the purchase price of Nash House was £6.5 million, did not exclude this implied term [225]. Lord Burrows also holds that had there been no such implied term, the same result would have been reached in the law of unjust enrichment [226-227];[236];[241].			
2023	uksc-2020-0056	Fearn and others (Appellants) v Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery (Respondent) [2023] UKSC 4 On appeal from: [2020] EWCA Civ 104	The Tate Modern (the Tate), a public art gallery in London, opened a new extension in 2016 called the Blavatnik Building. This building is ten stories high and, on its top floor, has a viewing platform which offers panoramic views of London.  The claimants own flats in a block of flats neighbouring the Tate that are at around the same height above ground as the viewing platform and have walls constructed mainly of glass. On the south side of the viewing platform, visitors can see directly into the claimants' flats.  At the time of the trial the viewing platform was open every day of the week and was visited by an estimated 500,000-600,000 people each year. The trial judge found that a very significant number of visitors display an interest in the interiors of the claimants' flats. Some look, some peer, some photograph, some wave. Occasionally binoculars are used. Many photographs have been posted online.  The claimants seek an injunction requiring the Tate to prevent its visitors from viewing their flats from the viewing platform, or alternatively, an award of damages. Their claim is based on the common law of nuisance.  The claims were dismissed by the High Court ([2019] EWHC 246 (Ch)) and, for different reasons, by the Court of Appeal ([2020] EWCA Civ 104). The claimants now appeal to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court (by a majority of 3 to 2) allows the appeal. Lord Leggatt, with whom Lord Reed and Lord Lloyd-Jones agree, gives the majority judgment. Lord Sales, with whom Lord Kitchin agrees, gives a dissenting judgment.	(i) Majority judgment  (a) Principles in the tort of private nuisance  The majority judgment reviews the core principles of the law of nuisance. In short, a nuisance is a use of land which wrongfully interferes with the ordinary use and enjoyment of neighbouring land. [9]-[11] To amount to a nuisance, the interference must be substantial, judged by the standards of the ordinary person. [22] Even where there is a substantial interference, the defendant will not be liable if it is doing no more than making a common and ordinary use of its own land. [27] What constitutes an ordinary use of land is to be judged having regard to the character of the locality, eg whether it is a residential or an industrial area.  It is no answer to a claim for nuisance to say that the defendant is using its land reasonably or in a way that is beneficial to the public. [47] In deciding whether one person's use of land has infringed another's rights, the public utility of the conflicting uses is not relevant. [121] The benefit of land use to the wider community may be considered in deciding what remedy to grant and may justify awarding damages rather than an injunction, but it does not justify denying a victim any remedy at all. [122]  (b) The application of the law in this case  The trial judge made findings that the claimants' flats are under near constant observation by visitors to the viewing platform. There are hundreds of thousands of spectators each year and many take photographs and post them on social media. The ordinary person would consider this level of intrusion to be a substantial interference with the ordinary use and enjoyment of their home. [48]  By contrast, inviting members of the public to admire the view from a viewing platform is not a common and ordinary use of the Tate's land, even in the context of operating an art museum in a built-up area of south London. [50] The Tate is therefore liable to the claimants in nuisance. The court heard no argument on the appropriate remedy and so remitted the case to the High Court to decide this question. [131]-[132]  (c) The errors of the trial judge  The trial judge reached the wrong conclusion as a result of three errors of law:  1. The judge applied the wrong test by asking whether, in operating the viewing platform, the Tate was making an 'unreasonable' use of its land, instead of asking whether it was a common and ordinary use. [54]-[55]  2. The judge considered that the claimants had exposed themselves to visual intrusion into their homes by choosing to live in flats with glass walls. It is right that, if the Tate had been making an ordinary use of its land, the claimants could not have complained about any visual intrusion resulting from the design of their flats. [62]-[63]But where, as here, a defendant is using its land in an abnormal and unexpected way, it is no answer to a claim in nuisance to say that the claimant would not have suffered a nuisance if their property had been of different design or construction. [72]-[75]  3. The judge also held that it was reasonable to expect the claimants to take measures to avoid being seen from the viewing platform, such as putting up blinds or net curtains. This wrongly placed the responsibility on the victim to avoid the consequences of the defendant's abnormal use of their land. [88]  (d) The error of the Court of Appeal  The Court of Appeal recognised that the judge had made these errors but decided that the claim must nevertheless fail because "mere overlooking" cannot give rise to liability for nuisance. It is true that a person cannot complain of nuisance because their flat is overlooked by another building or because people on the top floor of that building can look into their homes and see inside [90]-[91]. However, that is not the complaint made in this case. The claimants' complaint is that the Tate invites members of the public to look out from a viewing platform from which they can, and many do, peer into the claimants' flats and allows this activity to continue without interruption for most of the day every day of the week. [92] There is no reason why constant visual intrusion of this kind cannot give rise to liability for nuisance and, on the facts found by the trial judge, it does in this case.  (ii) Minority judgment  The minority considered that this appeal raises two questions. First, whether it is possible, in principle, for the tort of private nuisance to apply in the case of a residential property subject to the visual intrusion of people looking into the living areas of the property. Secondly, if this is possible, whether the Appellants have established that there is an actionable private nuisance by reason of the visual intrusion they experience from the Tate's viewing platform [134].  On the first question, the minority agree that it is possible, as a matter of principle, for a private nuisance to exist where residential property is subject to visual intrusion [158-169, 179]. On the second question, they consider that the answer depends on principles of reciprocity and compromise applicable to the Appellants and the Tate alike and the application of a standard of objective reasonableness informed by the character of the relevant locality, rather than focusing on whether a defendant’s use of its land is 'ordinary' [158-169, 226-249, 252].  The judge was better placed than an appeal court to determine the answer to the second question. He had not misdirected himself and was entitled to find that the use of the Appellants' land in the particular locality was not ordinary, that it was possible for them to take normal screening measures to limit the effect of any visual intrusion they experienced and that according to an objective standard of reasonableness the Tate had not committed a nuisance.

2023	uksc-2020-0208	R (on the application of Officer W80) (Appellant) v Director General of the Independent Office for Police Conduct and others (Respondents) [2023] UKSC 24 On appeal from: [2020] EWCA Civ 1301	W80, an armed police officer, shot Jermaine Baker dead in a police operation. Mr Baker was implicated in a plot to snatch two individuals from custody. The police had intelligence that the plotters would be in possession of firearms. W80's account was that during the intervention, Mr Baker's hands moved quickly up to a shoulder bag on his chest. Fearing for his life and those of his colleagues, W80 fired one shot. No firearm was found in the bag, but an imitation firearm was in the rear of the car.  An investigation was conducted by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (the "IOPC")'s predecessor, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (the "IPCC"). The IPCC concluded that W80's belief that he was in imminent danger was honestly held, but unreasonable, and that W80 therefore had a case to answer for gross misconduct on the basis of the civil law test that any mistake of fact could only be relied upon if it was a reasonable mistake to have made. It sent the report and recommendation to the Metropolitan Police Service (the "MPS"), as the appropriate authority for misconduct proceedings against W80. The view of the MPS was that the IPCC had been incorrect as a matter of law in applying the civil law test (which looks to whether an honest but mistaken belief is reasonable) as opposed to the criminal law test of self-defence (which looks to whether the belief is honestly held). The IPCC became the IOPC in January 2018, by virtue of the Policing and Crime Act 2017. After the MPS indicated that it would not follow the (now) IOPC's recommendation to bring misconduct proceedings against W80, the IOPC directed the MPS to do so. It is that decision which is challenged in this judicial review.  The Divisional Court held that the criminal law test applies. The Court of Appeal held that neither the criminal law test nor the civil law test applies but that a tribunal in police disciplinary proceedings should simply apply the test contained in the wording of the use of force standard in Schedule 2 to the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2012 ("the 2012 Regulations"), namely whether the force used was necessary, proportionate and reasonable in all the circumstances.  Officer W80 appeals against the decision of the Court of Appeal, arguing that the criminal law test applies in police disciplinary proceedings, with which the Metropolitan Police Commissioner agreed. The issue before the Supreme Court was therefore whether it is open to a reasonable disciplinary panel to make a finding of misconduct if an officer's honest, but mistaken, belief that his life was threatened was found to be unreasonable.	The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal, unanimously finding that the test to be applied in disciplinary proceedings in relation to the use of force by a police officer in self-defence is the civil law test. Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lord Stephens give the judgment, with whom all the other Justices agree.	The Standard of Professional Behaviour in the 2008 and 2012 Police (Conduct) Regulations does not expressly state whether the criminal law test or the civil law test applies in police disciplinary proceedings in relation to the use of force [93]. The Supreme Court concludes that the civil law test is the correct test, for several reasons:  The Standards of Professional Behaviour set out in the 2008 and 2012 Regulations are each framed as statements of objective fact. For instance, "officers … act with integrity". Accordingly, the standard in respect of the use of force should incorporate the degree of objectivity sought to be achieved under the Regulations, which cannot be achieved using the criminal test which includes a subjective element [94]. The word "knowingly" which had featured in the appropriate standard for police officers in relation to the use of force contained in the 1999 and 2004 Regulations was omitted from the 2008 Regulations and subsequent regulations. When the word "knowingly" was deliberately omitted in the 2008 Regulations, this was a strong textual indicator that the test to be applied thereafter was the objective civil law test [95]. The purpose of the disciplinary arrangements in the 2008 Regulations is not simply blame and punishment, but also achieving learning and development for the officer based on an employment model. This suggests that the civil test is more appropriate, so that the reasonableness of mistakes can be subject to a disciplinary process. [96-97] Interpretation of the Standard of Professional Behaviour as to the use of force in the 2008 Regulations cannot be informed by the Code of Ethics published four years later by the College of Policing in 2012. The Code of Ethics in fact expressly provides that in misconduct proceedings "the formal wording of the [2012 Regulations] will be used" [101]; The Court of Appeal attempted to find coherence between the 2008 and 2012 Regulations, previous iterations of the Regulations, and paragraph 4.4 of the 2012 Code of Ethics (which incorporates the criminal law test). The correct approach however is to interpret the 2008 and 2012 Regulations, acknowledging the fundamental shift brought about in the 2008 Regulations. Paragraph 4.4 of the Code of Ethics is wrong and misleading as it does not reflect the test in the 2008 and 2012 Regulations [102-103]. The obligation placed upon the IOPC Director General to have regard to the 2014 Guidance cannot mean that the Director General can disapply the 2012 Regulations or that he should be informed by para 4.4 of the Code of Ethics [104]. The test to be applied in England and Wales under the 2008 or 2012 Regulations is not informed by the different provisions governing police disciplinary proceedings in Northern Ireland and Scotland.[105]. The test to be applied in England and Wales under the 2008 or 2012 Regulations is not informed by Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which would not demand the application of the criminal standard in any case [109-111]. The test to be applied in disciplinary proceedings in relation to the use of force by a police officer in self-defence is the civil law test. The IOPC applied the correct test when directing the MPS to bring disciplinary proceedings against the appellant. Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed [112].			
2023	uksc-2020-0212	In the matter of an application by Rosaleen Dalton for Judicial Review (Northern Ireland)	This case principally concerns the extent to which the positive obligation on public authorities to investigate an individual’s death under article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the “Convention”), as given effect in the UK by the Human Rights Act 1998 (the “HRA”), extends to deaths that occurred before the HRA came into force. Sean Dalton died in a bomb explosion on 31 August 1988 in Derry/Londonderry. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (the “IRA”) took responsibility for the bomb. The police investigated but did not charge anyone. An inquest was held into Mr Dalton’s death on 7 December 1989, which concluded that he died from injuries suffered in the explosion. In February 2005, Mr Dalton’s son lodged a complaint with the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland (the “Ombudsman”) about the police’s behaviour in the lead up to and investigation of his father’s death. The Ombudsman investigated and reported his findings on 10 July 2013. The Ombudsman criticised the police in his report, finding that the police had failed to thoroughly investigate Mr Dalton’s death. He also noted that his own investigation had been hampered by missing documents and the refusal of some police officers to cooperate. On 25 July 2013, Mr Dalton’s family asked the Attorney General of Northern Ireland (the “AGNI”) to open a fresh inquest into Mr Dalton’s death. They contended that a fresh inquest was needed to take account of the Ombudsman’s report in particular because a coroner, unlike the Ombudsman, would be able to compel people to answer questions. The AGNI refused the request on 2 October 2014. On 26 June 2015, Mr Dalton’s daughter (Rosaleen Dalton) challenged the AGNI’s refusal in the High Court of Northern Ireland. The High Court dismissed this challenge on 28 March 2017. Rosaleen Dalton appealed to the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland. On 4 May 2020, the Court of Appeal allowed her appeal and remitted the matter to the AGNI for re-consideration. The AGNI appealed this judgment to the UK Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the AGNI’s appeal. It holds that Rosaleen Dalton cannot challenge the AGNI’s refusal to open a new inquest into her father’s death because it occurred outside the temporal scope (i.e., too long before the coming into force) of the HRA. The Supreme Court delivers four judgments: (i) Lord Reed, (ii) Lord Hodge, Lord Sales, and Lady Rose, (iii) Lord Leggatt, and (iv) Lord Burrows and Dame Siobhan Keegan, Lady Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. While allowing the appeal of the AGNI, the Supreme Court is unanimous in rejecting the AGNI’s submission that it should depart from the earlier decision of the Supreme Court in In re Finucane [2019] UKSC 7 (“Finucane”) and the obiter dicta (i.e., a statement of the law that was not strictly necessary to decide that appeal) of the Supreme Court in In re McQuillan [2021] UKSC 55 (“McQuillan”) at paragraph 144.	Although there are different degrees of emphasis, and some disagreement as to precisely what the European Court of Human Rights has decided on the temporal scope of the Convention, the main reasoning of the Supreme Court is as follows [44], [51], [170], [172], [260 – 261], [333 – 334], and [337]. First, the decision in Finucane should not be departed from, albeit that the Supreme Court disagrees with the wide multi-factorial reasoning that the majority of the Justices consider was adopted in that case. Second, the obiter dicta at paragraph 144 in McQuillan, with some slight amendments for clarity, set out the correct analysis. Third, that means that the obligation under article 2 of the Convention to investigate a death is only capable of applying to deaths which occurred within an outer period of 12 years before the HRA came into force on 2 October 2000 (unless what is called “the Convention values test” is met). In other words, if the death occurred more than 12 years before 2 October 2000, a court should strike out proceedings alleging a breach of this obligation unless the Convention values test applies. The Convention values test imposes an extremely high hurdle for someone seeking to rely on it. What is principally in mind are serious crimes under international law, such as war crimes, genocide, or crimes against humanity. Fourth, if the death occurred between 10 and 12 years before 2 October 2000 then a claim may only be brought in exceptional circumstances (even leaving to one side the Convention values test). Those circumstances (as explained in McQuillan at paragraph 144) are that any original investigation into the death can be seen to have been seriously deficient or non-existent and that the bulk of such investigative effort which has taken place, or which ought to have taken place, post-dates 2 October 2000. Fifth, the analysis of the law approved by the Supreme Court combines the certainty of two fixed periods (10 years and 12 years) with the flexibility, for the compelling reasons explained in paragraph 144 of McQuillan, to extend the primary period of 10 years to the outer period of 12 years. Sixth, if the death occurred less than 10 years before 2 October 2000, then it must still be shown that a major part of the investigation took place, or ought to have taken place, after 2 October 2000. Applying that analysis of the law to the facts of this case, because Sean Dalton’s death occurred more than 12 years before the HRA came into force on 2 October 2000, and because there is no question of the Convention values test being satisfied in this case, Rosaleen Dalton has no claim for the alleged infringement of her article 2 right under the HRA. Put another way, the domestic courts do not have jurisdiction under the HRA in respect of Mr Dalton’s death. That decision on the principal issue in the case is sufficient for the appeal of the AGNI to be allowed. Two Other Issues Six of the Justices (not including Lord Reed) dealt with two further issues. First, and contrary to the submissions for the AGNI, the six Justices are unanimous that the rationale of the article 2 procedural obligation – and hence the revival of the obligation to investigate following an earlier investigation – is not confined solely to investigations which may lead to the identification and punishment of the perpetrators [189], [216], and [316]. Secondly, in line with the submissions for the AGNI, three Justices (Lord Leggatt, Lord Burrows, and Dame Siobhan Keegan) consider that, in any event, the article 2 obligation was satisfied by the report of the Ombudsman so that no new inquest was required [232], [320], and [324]. The other three Justices (Lord Hodge, Lord Sales, and Lady Rose) take the view, without ruling on it, that that was strongly arguable [194]. Further the civil proceedings in this case give additional scope for involvement of the families and could potentially lead to a detailed examination of facts by a judge and a public judgement [194], [230], [321], and [324].			
2023	uksc-2021-0010	Brake and another (Respondents) v Chedington Court Estate Ltd (Appellant) [2023] UKSC 29	This appeal concerns the standing of a bankrupt to challenge the acts, omissions or decisions of the trustee of the bankrupt's estate under section 303(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986 (the "IA 1986").  Section 303(1) of the IA 1986 provides:  "If a bankrupt or any of his creditors or any other person is dissatisfied by any act, omission or decision of a trustee of the bankrupt's estate, he may apply to the court; and on such an application the court may confirm, reverse or modify any act or decision of the trustee, may give him directions or may make such other order as it thinks fit."  Section 168(5) of the IA 1986 is the equivalent provision applicable in the liquidation of a company, enabling "any person aggrieved" (which has been interpreted to include creditors and contributories of the company) to make applications as regards the acts or decisions of liquidators. By parity of reasoning, the approach adopted under section 303(1) applies equally to section 168(5).  Factual background  Between February 2010 and June 2013, Mr and Mrs Brake (the "Brakes") and Patley Wood Farm LLP ("PWF"), an investment vehicle for Mrs Brehme, were in partnership (the "Partnership") carrying on an accommodation and events business at West Axnoller House (the "House"). Disputes arose between the partners, which were referred to arbitration. The arbitration concluded with a final award in favour of PWF, a costs order against the Brakes and the dissolution of the Partnership.  The Partnership's property included a cottage, adjacent to the House, registered in the names of the Brakes and Mrs Brehme (the "Cottage"). The Brakes lived in the House but would use the Cottage when the house was temporarily let.  In 2015, the Brakes were made bankrupt on the petition of PWF in respect of the unpaid costs of the arbitration. A trustee was appointed on 30 July 2015 (the "Trustee").  In July 2015, receivers of the Partnership's property, who had been appointed by its bank, sold the farm to a company called Axnoller Events Ltd ("AEL"). The Partnership went into administration in July 2016 and into liquidation in May 2017.  In February 2017, AEL was acquired by the appellant in the present appeal, The Chedington Court Estate Ltd ("Chedington"), a company owned by Dr Guy and his wife. On 8 November 2018, the Brakes were given notice to quit the House by Chedington and AEL. Both Dr Guy and the Brakes expressed an interest in purchasing the Cottage. Accordingly, on 18 December 2018, the liquidators invited bids for the Cottage from the Brakes and Dr Guy.  On 20 and 21 December 2018, both Dr Guy (on behalf of Chedington) and the Brakes (in their capacities as trustees of the Brake Family settlement (the "Brake Trust") submitted bids for the Cottage. The liquidators accepted Chedington's higher bid, subject to contract. The liquidators were not willing to apply to the court for an order removing the Brakes as registered proprietors of the Cottage. Instead, Dr Guy and Chedington agreed an arrangement with the Trustee under which the Trustee would purchase the Cottage from the liquidator with funds lent by Chedington and would then sell the Cottage to Chedington, making the necessary application to the court to obtain clean legal title to the Cottage (the "Facilitation Agreement"). Pursuant to a notice provided by the Trustee to Dr Guy, agents of Chedington entered the Cottage and changed the locks on 18 January 2019.  The proceedings  The Brakes issued an application under section 303(1) of the IA 1986, both in their personal capacities as bankrupts and in their capacities as trustees of the Brake Trust, alleging that the Trustee wrongfully enabled Chedington to interfere with their right of possession of the Cottage.  Chedington applied to strike out the relevant parts of the application on the ground that the Brakes lacked standing under section 303(1) of the IA 1986. The High Court struck out the application.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal brought by the Brakes in their capacities as trustees of the Brake Trust, because in that capacity they were third parties whose only interest was as disappointed under-bidders for the Cottage. By contrast, the Court of Appeal held that, in their personal capacities, the Brakes had standing because their interests were substantially affected by the impugned conduct of the Trustee and because, as bankrupts, they had a direct interest in the relief they sought. Chedington now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Richards gives the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.	An applicant will have standing under section 303(1), or section 168(5), of the IA 1986 in three categories of cases [99]. First, creditors have standing where their application concerns their interests as creditors, because the bankrupt's estate or the assets of the company in liquidation are administered under the terms of the statutory trust for their benefit as creditors. Second, where there is or there is likely to be a surplus, the bankrupt or contributories are also persons for whose benefit the estate or assets are being administered and they have standing in respect of their interests in the surplus. Third, there is a limited class of cases where creditors, bankrupts, contributories or others will have standing, but only in respect of matters directly affecting their right or interests and arising from powers conferred on trustees or liquidators which are peculiar to the statutory bankruptcy or liquidation regime.  The Brakes did not fall within any of these categories and do not therefore have standing under section 303(1) of the IA 1986 [100].  In their personal capacities as bankrupts, the Brakes did not have any legitimate and substantial interest in the relief sought because their possessory rights to the Cottage were unconnected to their position as bankrupts. The actions of the Trustee which they challenge were directed to them as persons in possession of the Cottage, not as bankrupts [80].  The appellants submitted that all that is required for the purposes of standing is that a trustee, in that capacity, should have wrongfully interfered with an existing right of the applicant [81]. The consequences of this would be that any person whose rights were wrongfully interfered with by a trustee could apply for relief under section 303(1), provided only that the trustee was acting as trustee, and not (for example) in a personal capacity [82]. "Wrongfully" was taken to mean "unlawfully" in two senses [84]. First, it referred to conduct which is directly actionable by the complainant in any event, such as by an action in tort. The Court held that there is no sound basis for affording the complainant an alternative procedure for pursuing the claim just because the wrongdoer happens to be a trustee acting in that capacity, and there is no reason to think that the legislative intention behind section 303(1) was to provide any such alternative procedure [86]. Second, a complainant would have standing if the rights of the complainant were interfered with by the trustee acting beyond the trustee's statutory powers or in breach of duty as trustee [84]. The Court held that it is contrary to principle for a person to whom a duty is not owed to be able to seek relief in respect of a breach of that duty [87]. The enactment of section 304 of the IA 1986 demonstrates that it was not the legislative intention to enable such relief to be sought by third parties uniquely against trustees in bankruptcy under section 303(1) [88].  The Court noted that it was not the case that, if section 303(1) did not permit applications to be made in circumstances where the trustee has acted in breach of duty, the misconduct of trustees would go unchecked. Trustees in bankruptcy must be authorised to act as such pursuant to Part XIII of the IA 1986, normally by a recognised professional body. The maintenance of proper standards is the responsibility of those bodies, to whom complaints can be made in appropriate cases [98].			
2023	uksc-2021-0019	R (on the application of VIP Communications Ltd (In Liquidation)) (Respondent) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Appellant)	This appeal raises an issue of statutory construction. It arises in the context of a type of equipment known as commercial multi-user GSM (Global Systems for Mobile Communications) gateway apparatus ("COMUGs"). GSM gateways are telecommunications equipment containing one or more SIM cards, as used in mobile phones. They enable phone calls and text messages from landlines to be routed directly on to mobile networks, taking advantage of lower mobile call chargers. When a call is routed through a GSM gateway, the only data transmitted over the network is the number and location of the SIM card in the GSM gateway. It does not transmit information such as the identity of the calling party and (in the case of a mobile phone) the user's location, as would ordinarily be the case without a GSM gateway.  Under section 8(4) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (the "WTA 2006"), the Office of Communications ("Ofcom") is under a duty to make regulations exempting the installation and use of certain wireless telegraphy equipment from the requirement for a license under section 8(1) of the same Act, if satisfied that the conditions in section 8(5) are met as respects the use of that type of equipment. Under section 5(2) of the Communications Act 2003 (the "CA 2003"), Ofcom is under a duty to carry out its functions in accordance with directions given by the Secretary of State on very limited grounds, which include the interests of national security and public safety.  Following a public consultation, Ofcom published a notice in July 2017 stating its intention to make regulations under section 8 of the WTA 2006 exempting COMUGs from the licensing requirements of section 8(1). In response, the Secretary of State for the Home Department issued a direction that COMUGs should not be exempted by Ofcom (the "Direction"). The Direction, challenged in these proceedings, was given on the basis of serious national security and public safety concerns.  The High Court held that the Secretary of State had no power under section 5 to direct Ofcom not to comply with its duty under section 8(4) of the WTA 2006 to make regulations (exemption regulations) if Ofcom was satisfied that the conditions in section 8(5) were met. The Direction was therefore ultra vires (i.e. outside the Secretary of State's power). The Court of Appeal agreed, dismissing the appeal. The appellant now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Richards gives the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.	Under the legislation governing the installation and use of wireless telegraphy in force between 1904 and 2003, the Government had sole responsibility. Most of the Government's functions and powers under the legislation were transferred to Ofcom by the CA 2003, implementing the EU Directives known as the Common Regulatory Framework.  After setting out the complex legislation scheme [17]-[32], the court noted that it was obvious that the use of wireless telegraphy could give rise to national security concerns. National security, along with the other matters listed in section 5(3) of the CA 2003, are core functions of the Government, for which it is democratically accountable. A regulator, like Ofcom, is in no sense equipped to have responsibility for such matters [33].  It was beyond argument that Parliament's purpose in enacting section 5 was that, notwithstanding the extensive changes made to the regime for the control of wireless telegraphy, the Government should continue to be responsible for national security and the other matters listed in section 5(3) of the CA 2003 [39]. This continued division of responsibility was consistent with the Common Regulatory Framework [35]-[38].  Provisions such as section 5 of the CA 2003 and section 8 of the WTA 2006 are to be construed as if contained within a single statute, given they are dealing with a single system of regulation concerning wireless telegraphy [40]. In circumstances where the legislation has carefully divided responsibility between the Government and the regulator, reserving to the former powers only in respect of matters of vital national interest which are peculiarly within the competence of the Government, the court noted that it would be very surprising if those powers did not apply so as to prevent the making of an exemption regulation where, in the reasonable and proportionate judgment of the Government, the regulation would prejudice those interests [43].  This was reflected in the language of section 5(2) of the CA 2003. The drafter was not directing the language at any particular function, but was choosing words which could cover the whole field of those functions. Ofcom is as much carrying out one of its functions when, following a direction by the Secretary of State, it does not make exemption regulations as when it does make exemption regulations under section 8 of the WTA 2006 [49].  The court did not accept the existence, relied upon by the Court of Appeal as the principal basis for its decision, of a general principle of statutory construction that a statutory power to give a direction does not extend to a direction not to comply with a statutory duty arising under that or another statute, in the absence of clear words to that effect [53], [62]. It will be relevant to the assessment of rival interpretations of a provision that, on one view, it would permit a direction to be given that has the effect of precluding the performance of what would otherwise be a statutory duty, but that is no more than one of the factors which will need to be considered in arriving at the proper construction of the provision [62].			
2023	uksc-2021-0027	Sara & Hossein Asset Holdings Ltd (a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands) (Respondent) v Blacks Outdoor Retail Ltd (Appellant)	Blacks Outdoor Retail Ltd ("Blacks") rented commercial retail premises from Sara & Hossein Asset Holdings Ltd ("S&H") under two successive leases dated 2013 and 2018 (the "leases"). The leases stated that S&H as landlord should provide a certificate each year setting out the service charge sum payable by Blacks as tenant. The relevant clause stated that the landlord should provide a certificate "as to the amount of the total cost and the sum payable by the tenant" and that this was to be "conclusive" in the absence of "manifest or mathematical error or fraud" (the "certification provision"). Blacks refused to pay the service charge for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19, which amounted to £407,842.77, claiming that the service charge was excessive and included unnecessary items and expenses that were not properly due under the terms of the leases. S&H issued proceedings and sought summary judgment for the outstanding service charge, arguing that under the certification provision S&H’s certificate as to the sum payable was conclusive subject only to the defences that there had been a manifest error, a mathematical error or fraud (the "permitted defences"). Blacks argued that the true meaning of the certification provision was that S&H’s certificate was conclusive as to the amount of costs incurred by the landlord, but not as to Blacks’ liability for service charge. S&H’s application for summary judgment was dismissed by a Deputy Master in the High Court. A Deputy Judge of the High Court dismissed S&H’s first appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed S&H’s second appeal and entered summary judgment in S&H’s favour, remitting to the High Court the question of what, if any, counterclaims Blacks could pursue.	By a majority the Supreme Court dismisses Blacks’ appeal against the grant of summary judgment but holds that this does not preclude Blacks from pursuing a counterclaim in the High Court in relation to its underlying liability for the disputed service charge payments. Lord Hamblen gives the lead judgment, with which Lord Hodge, Lord Kitchin and Lord Sales agree. Lord Briggs gives a dissenting judgment.	The majority of the Supreme Court holds that neither party’s proposed interpretation of the certification provision is satisfactory.  S&H’s case is that its certificate is conclusive as to Blacks’ service charge liability, subject only to the permitted defences. Whilst that fits well with the wording of the certification provision, it is inconsistent with other provisions of the leases [44, 46]. Under the leases, the amount of service charge payable depends partly on the proportion of the overall premises that the tenant rents under the agreement. The leases contain a detailed dispute mechanism in relation to the assessment of that proportion, which may alter the amount payable by the tenant (the "proportion adjustment"). The certificate cannot, therefore, be entirely conclusive as to the sum payable by Blacks [40, 48, 54]. S&H’s interpretation also does not fit well with Blacks’ rights to inspect S&H’s receipts, invoices and other evidence relating to the service charge for up to 12 months after the certificate is provided. If S&H’s interpretation were correct, the only purpose of these detailed inspection rights would be to identify the rare case of fraud, since identifying the other permitted defences of manifest or mathematical error would be possible without extensive investigation. Any arguable issue identified on inspection could not be pursued by Blacks, meaning the lengthy and detailed inspection rights would be largely superfluous [33, 40, 48].  There are, moreover, many potentially arguable issues which may arise as to liability for service charge under the leases. The permitted defences are narrow and do not include an arguable error, however well founded the allegation of error may ultimately prove to be [30-34]. It would be surprising for the parties to agree that arguable issues as to liability could be determined conclusively by the landlord, as judge in his own cause, without any opportunity for the tenant to challenge the determination or even to make representations [37-39, 48]. It is a ’pay now, argue never’ regime. It is well established that in interpreting a contract one starts with the presumption that neither party intends to abandon any remedies which arise by operation of law and that clear words are necessary to do so [48].  Blacks’ case is that the certificate is conclusive only as to the landlord’s costs and not as to the sum payable by the tenant. However, this interpretation contradicts the natural and ordinary meaning of the certification provision that the certificate is conclusive both as to the "amount of the total cost" and "the sum payable by the tenant" [49]. There is also force in S&H’s submission that allowing Blacks to challenge payment of the service charge undermines the commercial purpose of enabling the landlord to recover costs and expenses with minimal delay and dispute [43, 47]. It is an ‘argue now, pay later’ regime.  The majority finds that there is an alternative interpretation that avoids these difficulties. That interpretation is that S&H’s certificate is conclusive as to what is required to be paid by Blacks following certification, subject only to the permitted defences. S&H is thereby assured of payment of the service charge without protracted delay or dispute, meaning its cashflow position is protected [51]. However, payment of the certified sum does not preclude Blacks from later disputing liability for that payment. This gives full effect to Blacks’ inspection rights and entitles Blacks to pursue arguable claims as to service charge liability [52]. It is a ‘pay now, argue later’ regime, a contractual arrangement which is commonly found. Adopting an iterative approach, this interpretation is consistent with the contractual wording, it enables all the provisions of the leases to fit and work together satisfactorily and it avoids surprising implications and uncommercial consequences [57].  The majority therefore dismisses the appeal but holds that this does not preclude Blacks from pursuing its counterclaim [58].  Lord Briggs dissents. In his view, the structure of the service charge regime in the leases and the ordinary meaning of the words used are irreconcilable with the majority’s judgment [62]. There is no reason why the provision for a dispute mechanism in relation to proportion adjustment should mean that the landlord’s certificate is not conclusive as to all other aspects of the tenant’s service charge liability [67]. Blacks’ inspection rights provide it with reasonable access to relevant documents in order to identify manifest errors, mathematical errors or fraud. The existence of those rights does not indicate that S&H’s certificate is not conclusive as to service charge liability [68]. Service charge disputes commonly result in complex and costly litigation. It is not uncommercial that S&H should have insisted on limiting the available grounds for litigation to the permitted defences [69]. Lord Briggs would therefore have accepted S&H’s proposed interpretation of the certification provision, meaning the certificate would be conclusive as to Blacks’ service charge liability [70].			
2023	uksc-2021-0028	McCue (as guardian for Andrew McCue)(AP)(Appellant) v Glasgow City Council (Respondent)(Scotland)	This appeal is concerned with the effect of the Equality Act 2010 (the "Equality Act") in relation to the provision of community care services to disabled persons pursuant to the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 (the "1968 Act") and the charges made for such provision. The appellant is Mrs Terri McCue, acting as guardian for her son, Andrew ("Mr McCue"). At the time of the hearing, Mr McCue was 27 years old. He has Down’s Syndrome and lives with his parents. He is disabled within the meaning of section 6 of the Equality Act. As a result of his disability, he is provided with community care services by the respondent, Glasgow City Council (the "Council"). Mr McCue is in receipt of income by way of various social security payments. Under section 87 of the 1968 Act, the Council has assessed Mr McCue’s means and levied charges for the community care services provided to him. The amount of the charges is affected by the amount of Mr McCue’s means. The greater his means, the more he will be liable to pay, and vice versa. The Council has to calculate what means are available to Mr McCue to meet any charges. In doing so, it has to make certain deductions in assessing the available amount. The higher the deductions made, the lower the charges and the more money Mr McCue retains to spend on other things. Over several years, starting in 2012, the appellant made representations to the Council on Mr McCue’s behalf that higher amounts should be deducted in the calculation of his available means in relation to expenditure relating to his disability. Save to a small extent, the Council was not persuaded by these representations. Therefore, the charges levied for the services have not been lowered as the appellant contends they should have been. In these proceedings, the appellant claims that by failing to make greater deductions for disability related expenditure, the Council unlawfully discriminated against Mr McCue on grounds of his disability, within the meaning of section 15 of the Equality Act. She also submits that the Council acted in breach of its duty under section 20 of the Equality Act, which requires it to make reasonable adjustments to take account of Mr McCue’s disability. The claim was dismissed at first instance and the Inner House of the Court of Session dismissed the appellant’s appeal. The appellant now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Sales gives the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.	The operation of section 87 of the 1968 Act: levying of a charge for community care services  Where a local authority provides services under the 1968 Act, then by virtue of section 87(1) it has a discretion whether to charge the recipient for those services and at what level any charge should be set [42]. By virtue of section 87(1A), if the individual satisfies the authority that his means "are insufficient for it to be reasonably practicable for him to pay" the amount which would otherwise be due, then the authority may not charge more "than it appears to them that it is practicable for him to pay". The onus is on the individual to satisfy the local authority that his means are insufficient to the extent that it is not "practicable" for him to pay [43].  The relevant question under section 87 is whether the Council is satisfied that Mr McCue, by his expenditure on the various items in dispute, has shown that his means are insufficient for it to be reasonably practicable for him to pay for the community care services provided to him by the Council, such that it is not "practicable" for him to pay a charge calculated without deduction of those items [46].  In relation to the disputed items of disability related expenditure, the Council’s assessment under section 87 was that they had not affected his means in such a way that would reduce what was practicable for him to pay by way of charges [52]. The Council had properly applied section 87(1) and (1A) and it was not contended that the Council had acted irrationally or in any way unlawfully, according to the usual general obligations arising under public law [46].  Section 15 of the Equality Act: unfavourable treatment  The principal question here was whether the Council had treated Mr McCue "unfavourably" because of something arising in consequence of his disability, within the meaning of section 15(1)(a) of the Equality Act.  A comparison is required between two states of affairs: what has happened to the complainant in fact and what would have happened to him in a counterfactual world without the treatment alleged to have been unfavourable. It is not necessary to identify a non-disabled comparator to find that there has been unfavourable treatment [55]. The comparison raises two simple questions of fact: what was the relevant treatment and was it unfavourable to the claimant? [57]  The relevant treatment in the present case was the Council’s application of section 87 of the 1968 Act in deciding that Mr McCue should be charged something for the services provided to him and its evaluation as to what deductions should be made in calculating Mr McCue’s available means and what sum it was practicable for Mr McCue to pay [58].  The Council charges both disabled and non-disabled persons according to the same basic scheme, applying section 87 of the 1968 Act to both groups [59]. The Council extends this general approach in a way which is more generous to disabled persons to take account of disability related expenditure, being costs over and above those which non-disabled persons must bear. The Council’s approach could not therefore be said to be unfavourable to disabled persons: in fact, it is favourable to them, since it allows for a greater range of possible deductions to be made in calculating their available means when the Council assesses the charges which it is practicable for them to pay [60]. The true nature of the appellant’s complaint was therefore that the treatment of Mr McCue was not generous enough, even though it benefits persons with disabilities; this is not a proper ground of complaint under section 15 [61].  Section 20 of the Equality Act: duty to make reasonable adjustments  In order to make good the claim under section 20, the appellant needed to show that a provision, criterion or practice of the Council put Mr McCue at a substantial disadvantage in relation to a relevant matter in comparison with persons who are not disabled, in order to be able to say that it must take reasonable steps to avoid the disadvantage [65].  The court was willing to infer from the parties’ written statements of case that the Council had adopted a practice according to which expenditures are rejected if they do not relate to disability; or if, while relating to disability, a person receives a benefit to meet the cost in question; or if the expenditure represents discretionary spending and are not necessary to meet the disabled person’s needs [73]. The practice did not put a disabled person at a disadvantage in comparison with non-disabled people for the simple reason that the practice only applies to disabled people. It does not allow for any comparison to be made with the treatment of non-disabled persons, so there is no scope for the application of section 20(3). Alternatively, one could also say that the practice of allowing the deduction of some, but not all, disability related expenditure confers an advantage on disabled people [74].			
2023	uksc-2021-0031	R (on the application of Day) (Appellant) v Shropshire Council (Respondent)	Land which is subject to a statutory trust in favour of the public is held by a local authority for the purpose of the public's enjoyment. In order for local authorities to dispose of this type of land they must comply with statutory consultation requirements. The issue raised by this appeal is what happens to the public's rights to use this type of land when the local authority disposes of the land but fails to comply with the statutory requirements.  This issue arises in the context of a challenge to the grant of planning permission by the Respondent, Shropshire Council to CSE Development (Shropshire) Limited ("CSE"). The land to be developed lies in Shrewsbury which is the county town of Shropshire. For many years the land was owned by Shrewsbury Town Council ("Shrewsbury TC") but in October 2017, Shrewsbury TC sold the land which was subject to a statutory trust to CSE. At the time Shrewsbury TC did not realise the land was subject to a statutory trust and so did not comply with the necessary consultation procedure under s. 123(2A) of the Local Government Act 1972 ("LGA 1972"). CSE then applied for planning permission to build houses on the land and Shropshire Council, which is the relevant planning authority, granted this.  The Appellant, Dr Day, is a local resident who opposes the development. Dr Day brought judicial review proceedings challenging the grant of planning permission. He argues that because Shrewsbury TC did not comply with the statutory requirements, the public trust continues to bind the land that CSE now owns. Accordingly, the grant of planning permission must be quashed because the existence of the trust was a material factor which Shropshire Council should have considered when deciding whether to grant planning permission.  The High Court dismissed Dr Day's application for judicial review. The judge held that even if the public's rights under the statutory trust had survived the sale, those rights were now unenforceable against CSE. The Court of Appeal dismissed Dr Day's appeal though their reasoning differed from that of the High Court. They held that the statutory trust was extinguished on the sale of the land. Dr Day now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lady Rose gives the judgment with which Lord Reed, Lord Kitchin, Lord Hamblen and Lord Stephens agree.	The local authority's powers to dispose of statutory trust land under the LGA 1972  Sections 123(2A) and (2B) LGA 1972 provide that before disposing of land which is subject to a statutory trust, the relevant council must advertise their intention to do so in the local newspaper for two consecutive weeks. They must then consider any objections to the proposed disposal that they receive. If the council disposes of land having complied with that procedure, then the land is freed from any public trust [3].  Separately, s. 128(2)(a) provides that a disposal of land which was subject to the consultation requirement "shall not be invalid by reason that" the requirement has not been complied with. Section 128(2)(b) goes on to say that the purchaser of the land "shall not be concerned to see or enquire" whether any such requirement has been complied with [7].  Shropshire Council argued that s. 128(2) extinguishes the rights enjoyed by the public under the statutory trust, or at least that the rights of the public to access the land did not survive in a form that gave rise to a material consideration that the planning committee needed to consider when deciding whether to grant planning permission [8].  The proper construction of s. 123(2A) and (2B) and 128(2) LGA 1972  Considering the history of the provisions, the Supreme Court holds that s. 128(2) does not extinguish the rights enjoyed by the public under the statutory trust. Those rights are only extinguished if the local authority complies with the bespoke consultation requirements set out in s. 123 LGA 1972 [91].  If Shropshire Council were correct that as soon as the land comes into private ownership, the trust must be extinguished, then it would be easy to get around the restrictions and conditions attached to the sale of statutory trust land. Furthermore, if this was the case, there would hardly be any need for the protection of the purchaser provided for under s. 123(2B) or s. 128(2)(b) [57].  Parliament used very clear words in s. 123(3) when setting out what the council needed to do in order to dispose of land in a way which extinguishes the public’s rights under the statutory trust. The elaborate provisions of s. 123 were evidently designed to ensure that members of the public should have the opportunity to learn about and object to a proposed sale of statutory trust land [101-102].  The Supreme Court holds that in light of the clear and specific wording in s. 123, the generally applicable provision in s. 128(2) cannot be used to override the statutory trust [103]. Section 128(2) confers a useful protection for people dealing in land with the authority. However, s. 128(2) is not designed to free land from the public trust when that land is sold [105-106]. Furthermore, in so far as the public’s rights in the land continue to exist, s. 128(2) does not have the effect of making these rights unenforceable against the purchaser [113].  The continuing existence of the statutory trust over the land is an important factor when considering a planning application. Thus, as this was not considered, the Supreme Court concludes that the grant of planning permission must be quashed [115].			
2023	uksc-2021-0038	R (on the application of Maguire) (Appellant) v His Majesty's Senior Coroner for Blackpool & Fylde and another (Respondents) [2023] UKSC 20	This appeal is concerned with the conduct of an inquest into the death of Ms Jacqueline Maguire ("Jackie"),1 who died in hospital on 22 February 2017, and the impact upon this of article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the "Convention"), which concerns the right to life.  Jackie, who had Down's Syndrome, lived in a care home for adults requiring round-the-clock supervision. In order to ensure she could be kept at the home under proper supervision, she was subject to a standard authorisation for deprivation of liberty made under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. In the weeks before her death, Jackie suffered symptoms including stomach pains and collapsing. On 21 February 2017, she suffered fits and the care home staff called an ambulance. However, when the ambulance arrived Jackie refused to go to hospital. The ambulance paramedics made an assessment of her condition, in the course of which they obtained advice from an out-of-hours GP who advised that, while it was desirable that Jackie should attend hospital, her condition was not so serious that they should override her wishes and force her to go.  The following morning, Jackie's condition had worsened and she collapsed again. Another ambulance was called and this time she was admitted to hospital. However, this proved to be too late. Shortly after her admission she suffered a fatal cardiac arrest. A post-mortem recorded that her cause of death was pneumonia and a perforated gastric ulcer leading to peritonitis.  The respondent (the "Coroner") opened an inquest into Jackie's death on 3 August 2017. The specific question which arises for determination in these proceedings is whether, in the circumstances surrounding Jackie's death, the effect of article 2 of the Convention was that the Coroner was required to direct the jury at the inquest to return an "expanded verdict" in accordance with section 5(2) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Such a verdict would involve a commentary about the circumstances in which Jackie came by her death, going beyond the standard verdict at an inquest, which is confined to how, when and where a person died.  The Coroner determined that an expanded verdict was not required; accordingly, he directed the jury to give a standard verdict. Mrs Muriel Maguire, Jackie's mother, subsequently brought a judicial review claim challenging the Coroner's determination. The High Court dismissed Mrs Maguire's claim. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. Mrs Maguire appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Sales gives the leading judgment, with which Lord Reed, Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lady Rose agree. Lord Stephens gives a short concurring judgment.	The Supreme Court set out the structure of the obligations imposed by article 2 of the Convention. In addition to prohibiting certain conduct, article 2 imposes a positive obligation on contracting states to take "appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within their jurisdiction" [9]. There are two types of substantive positive obligations: an obligation to have appropriate legal regimes and administrative systems in place to provide general protection for the lives of citizens and persons in its territory ("the systems duty") and an obligation to take operational steps to protect a specific person or persons when on notice that they are subject to a risk to life of a particularly clear and pressing kind ("the operational duty") [10].  Article 2 also imposes certain procedural positive obligations regarding the investigation of and the opportunity to call state authorities to account for potential breaches of the substantive positive obligations. The precise content of those obligations varies according to context [12].  Three different levels of the procedural obligation are identified. First, to check whether there might be any question of a potential breach of a person's right to life under article 2, state authorities should take some steps to establish whether the cause of death is from natural causes (the "basic procedural obligation") [14]. Second, in particular contexts, a state may be required to take further steps to investigate possible breaches of the article 2 substantive obligations to ensure appropriate accountability and redress and, as appropriate, to punish persons responsible for the death (the "enhanced procedural obligation") [15]. Third, in certain other cases where there is no relevant compelling reason giving rise to an enhanced procedural obligation, but there is still a possibility that the substantive obligations in article 2 have been breached, there is an obligation to provide means by which a person complaining of such possible breaches can make that complaint, have it investigated or obtain redress (the "redress procedural obligation") [19]. It is only where the enhanced procedural obligation applies that there is a statutory obligation on a coroner to direct a jury at an inquest to give an expanded verdict [27]-[33].  After detailed review of the relevant caselaw [34]-[62] and the facts of the case [63]-[114], the court considered the issues by reference to the headings set out below.  Was there an arguable breach of the systems duty on the part of the care home, so as to trigger the enhanced procedural obligation?  The systems duty in the context of healthcare services operates at a high level, is relatively easily satisfied, and it will only be in rare cases that it will be found to have been breached [145]. This same approach applies in the context of care homes [147]. The systems in place at the care home were capable of being operated in a way which would ensure that a proper standard of care was provided to residents, even though there may have been individual lapses in putting them into effect [146]; [156]; [165].  The Coroner examined the systems in place at the care home, as well as those in place for the various healthcare providers, and concluded that there was no arguable breach of the systems duty in relation to them. On the evidence, he was entitled so to find [153]; [155].  The submission was therefore dismissed [181].  Was there an arguable breach of the systems duty on the part of any of the healthcare providers, so as to trigger that obligation?  The arguments and the analysis under this heading are closely similar to those in relation to the care home [182]. Whilst criticisms could be made of individuals, these related to lapses in individual performances, rather than a failure of the systems duty [184].  Was there an arguable breach of the operational duty on the part of the care home, so as to trigger that obligation?  When an individual is placed in a care home, a nursing home or a hospital, the state does not assume responsibility for all aspects of their physical health [190]. The focus is on the specific risks to Jackie's health of which the authorities were aware [192]. The operational duty applies in a graduated way depending on their perception of the risk to Jackie [199].  The care home's responsibility was to look after Jackie on behalf of the state in substitution for her family. Their task was to ensure that she could access the healthcare which is available to the population generally [199] and this is what the care home staff sought to do [200]. There was therefore no arguable breach of the operational duty by the care home [204].  Was there an arguable breach of the operational duty on the part of any of the healthcare providers, so as to trigger that obligation?  When assessing whether the operational duty arose, it is necessary to take into account a range of relevant factors, including the desirability of fostering Jackie's sense of personal autonomy and a sense of trust between her and her carers, by respecting her wishes where possible [57]-[60]; [205]. None of the healthcare professionals involved was on notice that Jackie's life was in danger on 21 February 2017 and the paramedics gave proper consideration to the question of whether she ought to be removed forcibly to hospital. They made an assessment which was reasonable in the circumstances, that the risk to her was not so great as to make that appropriate [208]. As a result, there was no arguable breach of the operational duty by any of the healthcare providers [209].  In a concurring judgment, Lord Stephens sets out Jackie's personal circumstances to demonstrate her total dependence on others as to whether she should be treated at hospital [218]-[234]. Lord Stephens also considers the applicable legal framework [237]-[248].			
2023	uksc-2021-0047	News Corp UK & Ireland Ltd (Appellant) v Commissioners for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (Respondent)	Under the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (the "VAT Act"), "newspapers" are "zero-rated", meaning Value Added Tax ("VAT") is not charged on them. The question in this case is whether, between 30 August 2010 – 4 December 2016 (the "relevant period"), zero-rating extended beyond print newspapers to digital editions of newspapers, such as editions for e-readers, tablets, smartphones and websites. The decision will be applicable to the period up to 1 May 2020, after which there can be no dispute because Parliament has extended zero-rating from then on to newspapers "when supplied electronically", subject to exceptions.  News Corp UK & Ireland Ltd ("News Corp") is the publisher of The Times, The Sunday Times, The Sun and The Sun on Sunday. News Corp argues that the digital editions of these publications were subject to zero-rate VAT for the relevant period, as they are "newspapers" for the purposes of the VAT Act. Commissioners for His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (""HMRC") found that News Corp was not entitled to supply these digital editions at zero-rate VAT. News Corp appealed these decisions. The First-tier Tribunal found that digital editions are not "newspapers" for the purposes of the VAT Act, and so rejected News Corp's claim for recovery of over £35 million. The Upper Tribunal allowed News Corp's subsequent appeal. HMRC appealed to the Court of Appeal, which allowed its appeal. News Corp now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Hamblen and Lord Burrows give the lead judgment, with which Lord Hodge and Lord Kitchin agree. Lord Leggatt gives a concurring judgment.	Lord Hamblen and Lord Burrows hold that the issues in this case require the Supreme Court to apply principles of statutory interpretation and European Union ("EU") law. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU has no impact on the issues in this case, since the relevant EU law has become "retained EU law", and in any event the relevant period in this case expired before EU law would otherwise have ceased to apply [7].  The modern approach to statutory interpretation requires the courts to ascertain the meaning of the words used in light of their context and purpose [27]. In general, a statute should be interpreted taking into account changes that have occurred since it became law, even if those changes could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the statute was enacted. This is known as the "always speaking principle". Such changes might include technological developments, changes in scientific understanding, changes in social attitudes and changes in the law. Exceptionally, the always speaking principle will not be applied where it is clear, from the words used in the statute in the light of their context and purpose, that the relevant provision is tied to a historic interpretation [29-30].  With regard to EU law, it is well established that zero-rating provisions must be interpreted strictly, because they constitute exemptions to the general principle that supplies of goods and services by taxable persons should be subject to VAT [38]. The need for strict interpretation is particularly marked where, as in this case, it does not involve mandated EU exemptions, but rather national law exceptions [39]. The interpretation is also constrained by Article 110 of the Principal VAT Directive 2006/112 (the "standstill provision"), which requires that, so far as this appeal is concerned, categories of zero-rating cannot be expanded or extended beyond those which existed on 31 December 1975 [21, 40].  With these principles in mind, the starting point is the ordinary meaning of the word "newspapers" in its context as at 31 December 1975. At that date, "newspapers" referred only to printed newspapers. Those were the only kind of newspapers which existed at that time and digital editions lay many years in the future [44].  As for the purpose of the zero-rating of newspapers, the First-tier Tribunal found as a matter of fact that the social policy behind the zero-rating of newspapers was the promotion of literacy, the dissemination of knowledge and democratic accountability [45]. However, while that social purpose might also extend to digital editions, that finding is of limited assistance in determining the correct interpretation of "newspapers" because that same purpose could equally apply to many items that cannot possibly be covered by the word "newspapers", for example an online rolling news service [46]. From the perspective of EU law, the purpose of the standstill provision permitting the maintenance of zero rates in effect under national law as at 31 December 1975 was to prevent social hardship likely to follow from the abolition of existing national law exemptions. No social hardship could follow from the exclusion of digital editions from the ambit of the standstill provision as, at the time, nobody had access to them. Moreover, zero-rating for newspapers was seen as a transitional phase with the ultimate purpose being harmonisation across the EU with no VAT exemptions at all. This purpose, consistently with the strict approach to exemptions and the effect of the standstill provision, indicates that a narrow meaning should be given to the word "newspapers" [47].  In this case the always speaking principle must be applied having regard to the EU law constraints imposed by the standstill provision, the principle of strict interpretation of VAT exemptions and the harmonising purpose of the law on VAT. These constraints significantly limit the always speaking principle and mean that it should not be applied liberally [48-49]. As at 31 December 1975, the defining characteristics of a newspaper included: that it was news communicated through the medium of print in a physical form; and that the buyer of the newspaper obtained complete access to the news in that paper. There was no requirement of connectivity, so that access did not depend on owning or buying something else, such as a device [52-53]. Those characteristics reflect a conceptual difference between newspapers, which are goods, and digital editions, which are services. The difference is one of kind, not merely degree [54]. Given the significant difference, it cannot be said to be irrational to distinguish between the VAT treatment of printed newspapers and digital editions [55], and the rationality of such a distinction is borne out by the fact that it is drawn in EU VAT law [56]. Having regard to the constraints of EU law, the always speaking principle cannot be applied to interpret "newspapers" as covering digital editions [58].  The principle of fiscal neutrality, which requires that similar goods and services be treated the same way for VAT purposes, does not support News Corp's case, since the Court has not found that some forms of digital edition were to be zero-rated while others were not [61-63].  For these reasons, Lord Hamblen and Lord Burrows conclude that the term "newspapers" in the VAT Act is not to be interpreted as including digital editions [60]. They therefore dismiss the appeal [64].  Lord Leggatt agrees that the appeal should be dismissed, but differs in his approach. Lord Leggatt considers that the always speaking principle has been stated at too high a level of generality. Different types of changes may occur after a statute is enacted, to which different considerations apply [80]. When technology develops, the proper approach is simply to ask whether the newly invented object falls within the meaning of the statutory language, interpreted in the light of the legislative purpose [96]. The fact that digital editions did not exist at the relevant time makes no difference to whether they fall within the meaning of the term "newspapers" in the VAT Act [74, 96-97]. Nevertheless, Lord Leggatt agrees that the term "newspapers" cannot be taken to have included digital editions in light of: the requirement to interpret VAT exemptions strictly [106-107]; the nature and purpose of the legislation [103-105, 108-113]; and the relevance of the method of delivery of news content to consumers [115-119].			
2023	uksc-2021-0050	Jalla and another (Appellants) v Shell International Trading and Shipping Co Ltd and another (Respondents)	This appeal concerns the tort of private nuisance (a civil wrong) in the context of a major oil spill. The question at issue is whether there is a continuing private nuisance and hence a continuing cause of action. This is an important question because it affects when the limitation period for the bringing of claims (which in English law for torts is normally six years) starts to run. The claimants and appellants, Mr Jalla and Mr Chujor, are two Nigerian citizens. The defendants and respondents are both companies within the Shell group of companies. The Bonga oil field is located approximately 120km off the coast of Nigeria. On 20 December 2011, at 3:00am an oil leak lasting about six hours occurred during a cargo operation. The leak was caused by a rupture in one of the flowlines when crude oil was being transferred to a waiting oil tanker (the “Bonga Spill”). It is estimated that the equivalent of at least 40,000 barrels of crude oil leaked into the ocean. The defendants are alleged to be liable for the operation behind the Bonga Spill. The claimants have brought an action in the tort of private nuisance against the defendants for undue interference with the use and enjoyment of land owned by them caused by oil pollution from the Bonga Spill. They allege that the oil migrated from the offshore Bonga oil field to reach the Nigerian Atlantic shoreline where they claim it has had a devastating impact and has not been removed or cleaned up. Although the defendants dispute these claims, maintaining that the spill was successfully contained and dispersed offshore and that it did not impact the shoreline, it is assumed for the purposes of this appeal that some quantity of oil reached the Nigerian Atlantic shoreline within weeks of 20 December 2011. The issue of limitation arose when the claimants sought to make certain amendments to their claim form and particulars of claim over six years after the Bonga Spill. The claimants argue that so long as undue interference with their land is continuing, because oil on their land has not been removed or cleaned up, there is a continuing cause of action for the tort of private nuisance that is accruing afresh from day to day. That argument, which is being dealt with as a discrete preliminary matter, was rejected by the judge, and on appeal by the Court of Appeal. Mr Jalla and Mr Chujor now appeal to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously rejects the appeal. Lord Burrows gives the judgment, with which Lord Reed (President), Lord Briggs, Lord Kitchen and Lord Sales agree.	It is being assumed for the purposes of this appeal that the tort of private nuisance may be committed where the nuisance emanates from the sea or is a single one-off event [2]. (The defendants’ application for permission to cross-appeal on these issues was refused) [47-49]. The tort of private nuisance is committed where the defendant’s activity, or a state of affairs for which the defendant is responsible, unduly interferes with (or, as it has commonly been expressed, causes a substantial and unreasonable interference with) the use and enjoyment of the claimant’s land [2]. A claim in private nuisance is actionable only on proof of damage and is not actionable per se. This requirement is satisfied by establishing the undue interference with the use and enjoyment of the land. That includes physical damage to the land itself and damage to buildings or vegetation growing on the land. But commonly there will be an undue interference with the use and enjoyment of land – as by the impact of noise or smell or smoke or vibrations or being overlooked (as in Fearn v Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery [2023] UKSC 4, [2023] 2 WLR 339) – even though there is no physical damage to the land or buildings or vegetation [3]. A continuing nuisance is in principle no different from any other continuing tort or civil wrong [31]. In principle, and in general terms, a continuing nuisance is one where, outside the claimant’s land and usually on the defendant’s land, there is repeated activity by the defendant or an ongoing state of affairs for which the defendant is responsible which causes continuing undue interference with the use and enjoyment of the claimant’s land. For a continuing nuisance, the interference may be similar on each occasion but the important point is that it is continuing day after day or on another regular basis. So, for example, smoke, noise, smells, vibrations and overlooking are continuing nuisances where those interferences are continuing on a regular basis. The cause of action therefore accrues afresh on a continuing basis [26]. Applying the relevant principles to the facts of this case, the claimants’ argument that there is a continuing nuisance, because on the assumed facts oil is still present on their land and has not been removed or cleaned up, is rejected. If the claimants’ submission were correct, it would mean that if the other ingredients of the tort of nuisance were made out, and a claimant’s land were to be flooded by an isolated escape on day 1, there would be a continuing nuisance and a fresh cause of action accruing day by day so long as the land remained flooded on day 1000 [35]. The effect of accepting the claimants’ submission would be to extend the running of the limitation period indefinitely until the land is restored. [36]. There was no continuing nuisance in this case because outside the claimant’s land, there was no repeated activity by the defendants or an ongoing state of affairs for which the defendants were responsible that was causing continuing undue interference with the use and enjoyment of the claimants’ land. The leak was a one-off event or an isolated escape. The cause of action accrued and was complete once the claimants’ land had been affected by the oil [37]. The facts of this case are therefore distinguishable from a tree root case such as Delaware Mansions Ltd v Westminster City Council [2001] UKHL 55, [2002] 1 AC 321. In that case, in contrast to this, there was an ongoing state of affairs outside the claimant’s land, constituted by the living tree and its roots, for which the defendant was responsible and which, by further abstraction of water through the encroachment of the roots, caused continuing undue interference with the use and enjoyment of the claimant’s land [38]. To accept the claimants’ submission would undermine the law on limitation of actions, which is based on a number of important policies principally to protect defendants but also in the interests of the state and claimants, because it would mean that there would be a continual re-starting of the limitation period until the oil was removed or cleaned up [39]. It is not surprising that the claimants could cite no case directly supporting the position they were advocating. And while there may be no authority that directly contradicts that submission, it is contrary to principle and would have the unfortunate policy consequence of undermining the law of limitation [40]. The defendants were refused permission to cross-appeal, arguing that a private nuisance cannot be committed where the nuisance emanates from the sea or from a single one-off event such as the oil spill in this case.			
2023	uksc-2021-0056	Commissioners for His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (Appellant) v SSE Generation Ltd (Respondent)	SSE Generation Ltd ("SSE") claimed capital allowances on expenditure incurred when constructing a hydro-electric power station at Glendoe, Fort Augustus in Scotland. Such allowances may be deducted from income for the purpose of calculating a company's trading profits subject to corporation tax. Commissioners for His Majesty's Revenue and Customs ("HMRC") disputed certain allowances claimed by SSE for tax years 31 March 2006 to 31 March 2012 on the basis that in their view certain relevant assets did not give rise to allowable expenditure under the Capital Allowances Act 2001 (the "Act").  SSE appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (the "FTT"). The FTT held that SSE was entitled to some of the allowances claimed but upheld HMRC's view on others. HMRC appealed to the Upper Tribunal (the "UT"), who dismissed the appeal and allowed SSE's challenge to parts of the FTT's decision. As a result, the FTT remade the decision largely in SSE's favour. HMRC appealed to the Court of Appeal (the "CA"). The CA allowed the appeal in relation to certain parts of the UT's decision, but otherwise dismissed HMRC's appeal. HMRC now appeals to the Supreme Court and SSE cross-appeals.  The issue in the appeal before the Supreme Court is whether items constructed for the collection and transmission of water to, through and from the hydro-electric power station (the "disputed items") are a "tunnel" or an "aqueduct" within the meaning of those words as used in section 22 List B of Chapter 3, Part 2 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001. If they are then the expenditure on the disputed items does not qualify for capital allowances. The value of the expenditure on the disputed items is around £200 million.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal, holding that the disputed items are neither a "tunnel" nor an "aqueduct" within the meaning of those words as used in section 22 List B of Chapter 3, Part 2 of the Act. Lord Hamblen gives the judgment, with which all the other members of the Court agree.	In this case, the CA identified two possible ordinary meanings of both the words "tunnel" and "aqueduct". Where there are two possible ordinary meanings, it may be appropriate to rely on a thematic connection which explains the grouping of items in a list such as List B. This is an important part of the statutory context [31, 33]  The meaning of "tunnel"  HMRC contend that the ordinary meaning of the word "tunnel" is "any subterranean passage". While it is correct that this is one ordinary meaning of "tunnel", another ordinary meaning as given by the Oxford English Dictionary ("OED") is "a road-way excavated underground". In deciding which of those meanings was intended, the CA and the tribunals below were correct to consider the context and whether that assisted in identifying the correct meaning. In List B a choice has been made to identify specific structures which are to be excluded from capital allowances in all cases, to group those structures in separate lists and to decide the list to which each structure belongs. It is reasonable to conclude that those grouping choices were made for a reason, most obviously a thematic reason. The theme linking the group in which "tunnel" is included (which comprises "tunnel, bridge, viaduct, aqueduct, embankment or cutting") is that of structures related to the construction of transportation routes or ways [35]. Thus, a "tunnel" is a subterranean passage through an obstacle for a way (such as a railway, road or canal) to pass through [36].  HMRC observe that the word "tunnel" appears not only in section 22 List B of the Act, but also in section 23 List C. Items contained in List B are excluded from capital allowances, while items contained in List C are exceptions to those exclusions. HMRC contend that the presence of the term "tunnel" in List C saving certain sorts of tunnel from capital allowances disqualification (specifically "underground ducts or tunnels with a primary purpose of carrying utility conduits") strongly indicates that the use of the term in List B is not limited in meaning [34]. The Court rejects this argument. An underground passageway can have a primary purpose of carrying utility conduits, so there is no contradiction between the meaning given to "tunnel" by the Court and the meaning of the term in List C [38].  The meaning given to "tunnel" by the Court is based on an objectively reasonable contextual inference and is not speculative. The meaning is clear and 'draws a line in the sand' in accordance with the Act's statutory purpose to remove uncertainty as to where the boundary between capital-allowances-qualifying and non-qualifying expenditure lies [29, 34, 39].  The meaning of "aqueduct"  HMRC contend that the ordinary meaning of the word "aqueduct" is a conduit to convey water. While it is correct that this is one ordinary meaning of the word "aqueduct", another ordinary meaning given by the OED is a structure by which a canal is carried over a river. Other dictionaries give as their first or most common meaning of aqueduct a form of bridge- like structure for carrying water. As Rose LJ observed in the Court of Appeal, a bridge-like structure for carrying water is what "immediately comes to mind", an observation that reflects that common meaning.  In List B, "aqueduct" is listed immediately after "bridge, viaduct" and in the context of a theme of structures relating to the construction of transportation routes or ways. In that context, the Court considers that the term refers to a bridge-like structure for carrying water (such as where a canal is carried over a river or valley), which includes but is not limited to carrying a canal. That is its most common meaning and it makes good sense in the context of the statute [43, 45].  If, as HMRC contend, "aqueduct" simply meant a water conduit, it would be very surprising for it to be listed after "bridge, viaduct" and in the same grouping as "tunnel", "embankment" and "cutting", as it has nothing in common with those items. It would also render other water conduits specifically included in List B (such as "canal", "dike" and "drainage ditch") superfluous [44].  Conclusion  For these reasons, the Court rejects HMRC's suggested interpretations of both "tunnel" and "aqueduct" and upholds the decision reached by the CA. It is therefore unnecessary for the Court to consider SSE's alternative case raised by way of cross-appeal that the disputed items fall within List C [47].			
2023	uksc-2021-0059	Aviva Investors Ground Rent GP Limited and another (Respondents) v Williams and others (Appellants) UKSC 6	This appeal concerns the validity of a provision in a lease which allows the landlord to revise the proportion of the overall costs of maintaining the wider estate that a leaseholder should pay by way of a service charge.  The dispute relates to long leases of residential flats in a block in Southsea, Hampshire. The leaseholders were required to pay service charges towards the overall costs incurred by the landlord in maintaining the building and wider estate. Each lease provided that the leaseholder was to pay a specific percentage of the overall costs “or such part as the Landlord may otherwise reasonably determine”.  The landlords (Aviva Investors Ground Rent GP Limited and Aviva Investors Ground Rent Holdco Limited) sought to re-apportion the service charges by varying from the percentages specified in the leases. A number of the leaseholders (the Appellants) objected to this and brought a claim in the First-tier Tribunal. They claimed that the re-apportionment was unreasonable and in any event void on account of section 27A(6) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.  Section 27A of the Act allows for disputes relating to service charges in residential leases to be resolved by application to the First-tier Tribunal (in England or the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal in Wales). Section 27A(6) provides that an agreement by a residential tenant “is void in so far as it purports to provide for a determination (a) in a particular manner, or (b) on particular evidence, of any question which may be subject of an application [to the First-tier Tribunal under section 27A] ”. In essence this means that a clause in a lease which gives the landlord the right to determine issues relating to the service charges that ought to be determined by the Tribunal will not be effective, but the exact scope of this provision was in dispute in this case.  The First-tier Tribunal rejected the leaseholders’ complaints. It held that the provision of the leases giving the landlords the ability to vary the proportion of the service charge payable by each tenant was not void. It also determined that the re-apportionments were reasonable.  On the leaseholders’ appeal the Upper Tribunal held that the re-apportionment provision was void on account of Section 27A(6). There was therefore no ability to vary the apportionment and so the leaseholders only had to pay the percentage of the costs originally fixed in their leases unless they agreed otherwise.  On the landlords’ further appeal the Court of Appeal held that the re-apportionment provision was not wholly void. Instead the effect of section 27A(6) was to transfer the discretion to vary the service charge proportions from the Landlord to the First-tier Tribunal. It therefore allowed the appeal and restored the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  The leaseholders appealed to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the leaseholders’ appeal and, for reasons different to those given by the Court of Appeal, approves the decision of the First-tier Tribunal that the revised apportionment is valid. Lord Briggs gives the only judgment, with which the other members of the Court agree.	The key issue for the Court was the true effect of Section 27A(6) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. That Act provides various controls on a landlord’s ability to determine the service charge payable by tenants. Section 27A gives the First-tier Tribunal jurisdiction to decide whether a service charge demanded by a landlord is or would be payable. It does not give any details about how the First-tier Tribunal is to decide what is payable. The natural inference is that it will make any determination based on the provisions of the lease and any applicable contractual or statutory restrictions, for example it can determine whether the costs claimed have been reasonably incurred as is required by the Act [10]-[12]. That would not include the First-tier Tribunal exercising for itself management decisions that are within the discretion of the landlord, such as deciding what works to carry out [14]-[16].  The Court considers that section 27A(6) is plainly an anti-avoidance provision, which is designed to preserve the jurisdiction of the First-tier Tribunal [13]. It is not the purpose or effect of Section 27A(6) to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or to deprive the landlord’s managerial decisions of their ordinary contractual effect. Rather its purpose is to prevent the parties to a lease agreeing a different mechanism to determine a question that could otherwise be decided by the First-tier Tribunal. Therefore, a contractual provision will be void only to the extent it purports to oust the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, for example by making the landlord’s (or some other person’s) decision final and binding, or requiring the Tribunal to presume or ignore certain facts [28]-[29]; [32].  The Court disapproves the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of Section 27A(6) and the previous case law it was based on. That interpretation would have the effect that every discretionary management decision which would affect the amount of a tenant’s service charge, such as what works to carry out, would be transferred to the First-tier Tribunal. This would greatly extend the jurisdiction of the First-tier Tribunal. It is unlikely that an anti-avoidance provision would be intended to have that effect, and a natural reading of the provision does not require it. Moreover, it would also have undesirable consequences, in that a landlord would never safely be able to incur costs without first seeking a decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to whether those could be charged to its tenants. This could lead to a flood of applications that would overwhelm the tribunal system [19]-[24];[26];[30]-[32].  The Court also disagrees with the leaseholders’ approach, which the Upper Tribunal adopted. That would have the effect of removing altogether the ability to vary the apportionment, even though re-apportionment was not offensive to the purpose of legislation. This would leave the apportionment fixed for the 125-year term of the lease, which is a commercially unattractive result that the parties had not intended [25].  In this case, the agreement that the landlords were entitled to adjust the proportions of the leaseholders’ service charges did not remove the jurisdiction of the First-tier Tribunal. The Tribunal was still able to review whether the adjustments were reasonable, as was required by the leases. The Tribunal had determined that they were reasonable. Therefore section 27A(6) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 was not engaged, and the re-apportionments were valid [33].			
2023	uksc-2021-0078	R (on the application of PACCAR Inc and others) (Appellants) v Competition Appeal Tribunal and others (Respondents) [2023] UKSC 28	This appeal is concerned with a matter of statutory interpretation in the context of litigation funding. Litigation funding involves the agreement of a third party (with no prior connection to the litigation) to finance all or part of the legal costs of certain litigation, in return for a percentage of any damages recovered should the funded litigant be successful. In particular, this appeal concerns whether each of the agreements to provide this funding, known as litigation funding agreements ("LFAs"), constitute a "damages-based agreement" ("DBA"), a term given a specific definition by statute. In order to be lawful and enforceable a DBA has to satisfy certain conditions. The LFAs have been entered into without satisfying those conditions, so the question whether they constitute DBAs is critical for their enforceability.  The issue arises in the context of applications to bring collective proceedings for breaches of competition law. The second respondent ("UKTC") and the third respondent ("RHA") each sought an order from the Competition Appeal Tribunal (the "Tribunal") to enable them to bring collective proceedings on behalf of persons who acquired trucks from the appellants (collectively, "DAF") and other truck manufacturers. The proposed proceedings take the form of "follow-on" proceedings in which compensation is sought for the alleged higher prices paid for trucks as a result of the breach of European competition law, as found in the infringement decision of the European Commission dated 16 July 2016. To obtain a collective proceedings order from the Tribunal, UKTC and RHA needed to show that they had adequate funding arrangements in place to meet their own costs and any adverse costs order made against them should they lose. Both UKTC and RHA relied on the LFAs in an effort to meet these requirements.  Section 154 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 ("CJA 2009") inserted section 58AA into the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 ("CLSA 1990"). Section 58AA(1) and (2) provide that a DBA will be unenforceable unless certain conditions are complied with. Shortly after the insertion of section 58AA, the Damages Based Regulations 2013 (the "DBA Regulations 2013") came into force. These set out further requirements which must be satisfied if a DBA is to be enforceable. It is accepted that the LFAs in this appeal would not satisfy these conditions.  The relevant part of the definition of DBA in this appeal, pursuant to section 58AA(3), is whether the LFAs involve the provision of "claims management services". This phrase is defined, under section 58AA(7), by reference to earlier legislation, being the Compensation Act 2006 ("CA 2006") until 1 April 2019 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA 2000") thereafter. These refer to regulated "claims management services". Such a service is regulated only if prescribed by the Secretary of State or specified in an order made by the Treasury. "Claims management services" are defined in the CA 2006 and FSMA 2000 in materially the same terms. Under section 4(2)(b) of the former, such services are "advice or other services in relation to the making of a claim" and "other services" includes, in particular, a reference to "the provision of financial services or assistance".  The Tribunal held that the LFAs did not involve the provision of "claims management services". As a result, they were not DBAs and were not therefore rendered unenforceable by virtue of section 58AA(2). The Divisional Court dismissed the appeal. The appellants appeal under the leap-frog procedure directly to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court allows the appeal by a majority. Lord Sales gives the leading judgment, with which Lord Reed, Lord Leggatt and Lord Stephens agree. Lady Rose gives a dissenting judgment.	An important feature of this appeal is that the definition of DBA, derived from one legislative context (the CA 2006), has been used in a different legislative context (section 58AA of the CLSA 1990). The meaning of the definition has not changed. The meaning has to be determined with reference to the CA 2006.  In relation to the wording of section 4 of the CA 2006, the Court held that the words "claims management services" read according to their natural meaning were capable of covering the LFAs [50]. In relation to the statutory purpose, the Court held that Part 2 of the CA 2006 was intended to provide a broad power to allow the Secretary of State to decide what targeted regulatory response might be required from time to time as information emerged about what was then a new and developing field of services seeking to encourage or facilitate litigation, where the business structures were opaque and poorly understood at the time of enactment. The wide language used in section 4 [63]-[65], and the degree of parliamentary control for the future exercise of the section 4 power, which is a feature of the scheme of Part 2 [60], [62], were strong indicators of this. Viewed in this light, there was good reason to think that Parliament used wide language in section 4 deliberately and with the intention that the words of the definition should be given their natural meaning [72].  The DBA Regulations 2013 are not a permissible aid to interpreting "claims management services", as defined in the CA 2006. They were not introduced broadly contemporaneously in combination with the CA 2006 as part of a single coherent scheme, nor were they subject to review by the same Parliament which enacted the 2006 Act [47]. By contrast, the Compensation (Regulated Claims Management Services) Order 2006 (the "Scope Order") was broadly contemporaneous and formed part of the same legislative scheme as, and so is a legitimate aid to interpretation of, the CA 2006; as is the Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied the Scope Order [46]. The Scope Order and the Explanatory Memorandum support the interpretation of the definition of DBA for which the appellants contend [61], [73].  The respondents relied on the wording of the defined term itself - "claims management services" - to submit that the definition should be limited to services in the context of the management of a claim. This notion was referred to as "the potency of the term defined". The Court held that this notion was not relevant to the appeal for three reasons. First, the terms explicitly used in the definition in the primary legislation and also in the Scope Order cannot be read as involving the management of claims, nor as having claims management as a unifying core of meaning [78]. Second, "claims management services" had no established and generally accepted meaning which could lead a reader of the text of section 4 to suppose that the express language of the definition was to be treated as qualified or coloured by that meaning [79]. Third, to read the definition in section 4 in this way would be counter to the scheme and purpose of the CA 2006 [83].  The Court also held that the interpretation of section 4 of the CA 2006 as covering the LFAs in this case did not produce any absurdity in relation to section 58B, which section 28 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 inserted into the CLSA 1990 but which had not been brought into force, to make enforceable certain other forms of LFAs which were otherwise thought to be unenforceable [84]. Further, the Court held that events subsequent to 2006 were not relevant to the interpretation of section 58AA [90], [94].  Lady Rose dissents and would dismiss the appeal. She agrees with the Divisional Court and the Tribunal that the provision of financial assistance is only included in the term "claims management services" if it is given by someone who is providing claims management services within the ordinary meaning of that term [154]. Lady Rose holds that the fact that litigation funding would not naturally fall within the scope of the term "claims management services" is important [111]. This points to the fact that claims management services include providing financial assistance, but that this does not mean that all financial assistance constitutes "claims management services" whenever it relates to a claim [115]-[122].			
2023	uksc-2021-0085	Republic of Mozambique (acting through its Attorney General) (Appellant) v Privinvest Shipbuilding SAL (Holding) and others (Respondents) [2023] UKSC 32	Between 2013 and 2014, three corporate vehicles (the "SPVs") wholly owned by the Republic of Mozambique ("Mozambique") entered into supply contracts (the "Contracts") with three of the respondents (the "Privinvest companies") for the development of Mozambique's exclusive economic zone. The Contracts are governed by Swiss law. Two of the Contracts provide for dispute resolution by arbitration of "all disputes arising in connection with" the relevant project governed by the Contract. The third Contract provides for dispute resolution by arbitration of "any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, or in relation to" the relevant Contract (the "arbitration agreements").  The SPVs borrowed the purchase funds from various banks, for which borrowing Mozambique granted sovereign guarantees (the "Guarantees"). The Guarantees are governed by English law and provide for dispute resolution in the courts of England and Wales.  Mozambique accuses the Privinvest companies and others of paying significant bribes to Mozambique's officials, and exposing it to a potential liability of approximately US$2bn under the Guarantees. Accordingly, in 2019 Mozambique brought claims in England and Wales seeking damages resulting from its entering into the Guarantees.  The respondents ("Privinvest") say that the Contracts have essentially been performed. Mozambique does not accept that what Privinvest has provided conforms to contract or is of material benefit to it. Privinvest asserts that it provided valuable goods and services and that the Republic has squandered them and sabotaged the project for reasons of internal politics.  While Mozambique is not a signatory to the Contracts, Privinvest contends that, as a matter of Swiss law, Mozambique is bound by the arbitration agreements within them. On that basis, Privinvest sought a stay of all Mozambique's claims pursuant to section 9 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (the "1996 Act"). Section 9 provides that a party to an arbitration agreement (such as those in the Contracts) against whom legal proceedings are brought in respect of a "matter", which under the agreement is to be referred to arbitration, may apply to the court to stay the proceedings so far as they concern that matter. On such an application the court must grant a stay unless satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed.  As a preliminary question, the issue arose as to whether Mozambique's claims in the legal proceedings were "matters" which fell within the scope of the arbitration agreements under section 9 of the 1996 Act. At first instance, the High Court held the claims were not. The Court of Appeal disagreed on appeal. Mozambique now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Hodge gives the judgment, with which Lord Lloyd-Jones, Lord Hamblen, Lord Leggatt and Lord Richards agree.	(1) The meaning and ascertainment of a "matter"  As section 9 of the 1996 Act gives effect to article II(3) of the UN Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958) (the "New York Convention"), the Supreme Court holds that it is appropriate to consider other countries' jurisprudence as guides to section 9's interpretation, to the extent that they have similarly worded statutory provisions, and to adopt broad and generally accepted principles in interpreting the 1996 Act [53]-[55].  The Supreme Court notes that English law, like many other legal systems, adopts a pro-arbitration approach. It is in this context that section 9 of the 1996 Act must be interpreted [45]-[47]. Following its review of several jurisdictions' case law, the Supreme Court holds that there is also a general international consensus on the determination of "matters" which must be referred to arbitration among the leading arbitration jurisdictions in the common law world that are signatories of the New York Convention [49]-[52]; [56]-[71].  First, in applying section 9 of the 1996 Act, the court will adopt a two-stage test: first, the court must identify the matter or matters which the parties have raised or foreseeably will raise in the court proceedings, and, secondly, the court must determine in relation to each such matter whether it falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement. The court must ascertain the substance of the dispute(s) between the parties, without being overly respectful to the formulations in the claimant's pleadings, and have regard to the defences raised or reasonably foreseeable [48]; [72]-[73].  Secondly, the "matter" need not encompass the whole of the dispute between the parties; section 9 has expressly provided for stays to be granted in relation to part of the court proceedings [74].  Thirdly, a "matter" is a substantial issue that is legally relevant to a claim or a defence which is susceptible to determination by an arbitrator as a discrete dispute, rather than an issue which is peripheral or tangential. If the "matter" is not an essential element of the claim or of a relevant defence to that claim, it is not a "matter" in respect of which the legal proceedings are brought [75]-[76].  Fourthly, the test entails a matter of judgment and the application of common sense [77].  Although there may not yet be a consensus among the relevant signatories to the New York Convention, the Supreme Court finds that common sense lends further support to a fifth point: when turning to the second stage of the analysis, the court must have regard to the context in which the "matter" arises in the legal proceedings and recognise a party's autonomy to choose which of several claims it wishes to advance [78]-[80].  The Supreme Court holds that Mozambique, in seeking damages resulting from entering into the Guarantees, is asserting that it did not get value for the monetary obligations it entered into [85]. The substance of the controversy is whether the transactions, including the Contracts and the Guarantees, were obtained through bribery, and whether Privinvest had knowledge at the relevant time of the alleged illegality of the Guarantees [93]. In relation to each of Mozambique's allegations, the Supreme Court notes that it would not be necessary for the court to examine the validity of the Contracts. Moreover, a defence that the Contracts were valid and on commercial terms would not be relevant to the question of Privinvest's liability: it would be relevant only in relation to the quantification of the loss suffered by Mozambique [86]-[91]. As the validity and commerciality of the Contracts are not essential to any relevant defence, the Supreme Court holds that they are not "matters" under section 9 of the 1996 Act in relation to the question of Privinvest's liability [94].  The Supreme Court notes that the extent of loss and damage allegedly suffered by the claimant may often be a substantial issue which is in dispute between the parties. The extent to which Privinvest gave value for money in its performance of the Contracts will be a relevant issue in the quantification of the Republic's claims. The Supreme Court, however, finds that there is no case law in which section 9 of the 1996 Act has been invoked to obtain a stay solely in relation to a question of the quantification of a claim. As the Supreme Court has decided the appeal by reference to the scope of the arbitration agreements, it is not necessary to decide whether the quantification of Mozambique's claims is a "matter" in the legal proceedings. [95]-[98].  (2) The scope of the arbitration agreements  The question of the scope of each of the arbitration agreements is a question of construction, governed by Swiss law [99].  The Supreme Court holds that the court, in ascertaining the scope of an arbitration agreement, must have regard to what rational businesspeople would contemplate. As Waksman J pointed out, the context is one of multiple arbitration clauses focused on individual contracts [103]. Rational businesspeople are likely to intend that any disputes arising out of their contractual relationship be decided by the same tribunal [105]. In this case, there is no question of the arbitration agreements extending to cover the Republic's allegations on which it relies to establish Privinvest's legal liability [106]. Section 9 of the 1996 Act must be applied with common sense [107]. With respect to the dispute over the partial defence to the quantification of Mozambique's losses, rational businesspeople would not seek to send such a subordinate factual issue to arbitration. Construed accordingly, the partial defence does not fall within the scope of the arbitration agreements [107-109].			
2023	uksc-2021-0087	Jones (Appellant) v Birmingham City Council and another (Respondents) [2023] UKSC 27	The background to this appeal is gang-related violence across the United Kingdom, which is often concentrated in larger cities. Gang-related violence is often connected to drug-dealing, and may also involve firearms offences, obstruction of justice and other illegal activity which threatens public safety and the rule of law. While this activity is usually directed toward other gang members, non-gang-member civilians can be caught in the crossfire.  Birmingham is one UK city which has been heavily affected by gang violence. The Guns and Money Gang ("GMG") is one of the gangs linked to violence in Birmingham which has been affecting residents there for over thirty years. In February 2016, following investigation by the West Midlands Police, proceedings were commenced by Birmingham City Council against the appellant, Mr Jerome Jones, and 17 other defendants, all of whom were said to be members of the GMG or a rival gang.  Birmingham City Council applied to Birmingham County Court for injunctions to prevent the defendants from engaging in gang-related violence and drug-dealing activity. The injunctions were requested pursuant to section 34 of the Policing and Crime Act 2009 ("the 2009 Act") and in the alternative under Part 1 of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 ("the 2014 Act"). Interim injunctions were granted against the defendants in February 2016. The appellant applied for the injunction claim in his case to be transferred the High Court where he applied for a declaration that it was incompatible with article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights ("ECHR").  More specifically, the application concerned the question whether article 6(1) ECHR, as given effect within the United Kingdom by the Human Rights Act 1998 ("HRA 1998"), requires the criminal standard of proof (i.e. proof beyond a reasonable doubt) to be satisfied in respect of:  Proof that a person has engaged in or has encouraged or assisted gang-related violence or gang-related drug dealing activity within section 34(2) of the 2009 Act; and Proof that a person has engaged or threatens to engage in anti-social behaviour within section 1(1) of the 2014 Act. In the High Court, Burton J held that the proceedings in this case were not in respect of a criminal charge and did not require the application of the criminal standard of proof. The trial of the injunction action was held in the Birmingham County Court in 2017. Judge Wall applied the civil standard of proof (i.e. on the balance of probabilities) to the question of whether Mr. Jones had been involved in gang-related drug-dealing activity and therefore satisfied the first condition in section 34(2) of the 2009 Act. Judge Wall concluded that the condition was satisfied and granted an injunction against Mr. Jones pursuant to sections 34-36 of the 2009 Act, as amended by the Crime and Security Act 2010 and the 2015 Act. The injunction which was granted against Mr Jones included provisions preventing him from entering a large area in central Birmingham, associating with or contacting ten people named in the injunction, and participating in music videos containing material which might relate to gangs operating in Birmingham.  Mr. Jones appealed the order of Burton J to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal held that:  Proceedings under section 34 of the 2009 Act do not involve a criminal charge within article 6(1) of the ECHR; and The standard of proof for proving the threshold conditions prescribed by section 34 of the 2009 Act for applications for injunctions in respect of gang-related drug-dealing and by section 1(2) of the 2014 Act for applications for injunctions in respect of anti-social behaviour, namely proof on the balance of probabilities, is compatible with article 6 of the ECHR. Mr. Jones now appeals to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal. It is no longer argued that the proceedings against him under section 34 of the 2009 Act involve a criminal charge within article 6(1) of the ECHR. The principal issues on this appeal are as follows:  Whether the Court of Appeal erred in law by distinguishing and declining to follow the decision of the House of Lords in R (McCann) v Crown Court at Manchester [2003] 1 AC 787 ("McCann") that the criminal standard of proof should be applied in proceedings in respect of an anti-social behaviour order under section 1, Crime and Disorder Act 1998 ("the 1998 Act"), and in failing to apply that standard of proof to applications for injunctions under section 34 of the 2009 Act and section 1 of the 2014 Act; and If the Court of Appeal was entitled to depart from the decision of the House of Lords in McCann, whether it, in any event, erred in law in holding that the criminal standard of proof did not need to be applied to the first condition under section 34 of the 2009 Act and section 1(2) of the 2014 Act in order to satisfy the requirements of fairness in article 6(1) of the ECHR when considering whether to make an injunction under either or both of those provisions.	The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal, unanimously holding that ([66-67]):  Article 6(1) of the ECHR, as given effect by the HRA 1998, does not require the criminal standard of proof to be satisfied in respect of (a) proof that a person has engaged in or has encouraged or assisted gang-related violence or gang-related drug dealing activity within section 34(2) of the 2009 Act or (b) proof that a person has engaged or threatens to engage in anti-social behaviour within section 1(1) of the 2014 Act; Under Part 4 of the 2009 Act and Part 1 of the 2014 Act Parliament has devised statutory schemes which conform with the requirements of a fair hearing under article 6 of the ECHR. Lord Lloyd-Jones gives the judgment, with which all the other Justices agree.	The Supreme Court finds that there is no authority from the European Court of Human Rights for the proposition that a fair hearing under article 6(1) ECHR requires the application of the criminal standard of proof in circumstances such as those in the present appeal. [38] In fact, Article 6(1) of the Convention does not lay down any rules on the burden or standard of proof, which are essentially a matter for domestic law. [36] While it would be open to the Strasbourg court to develop its jurisprudence on article 6(1) so as to require the application of the criminal standard of proof in such circumstances, there is no sign in its case law to date that such a development is likely. [38]  The McCann case is not authority for the proposition that anti-social behaviour within section 1(1)(a) of the 1998 Act is required to be proved to the criminal standard. The standard of proof under section 1(1)(a) of the 1998 Act was the civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities and to the extent that any reasoning in the McCann opinions is to the contrary effect, it is wrong. McCann does not support the proposition that the criminal standard of proof must be applied to the requirements of evidence upon which a gang injunction can be granted under the 2009 and 2014 Acts. [56]  In respect of the 2009 Act and 2014 Act, Parliament has expressly provided that the standard of proof applicable in relation to the granting of gang injunctions in both Acts shall be the civil standard. In the light of this express provision, there is no room for the courts to decide that as a matter of common law fairness the criminal standard should be applied. [58] The adoption of the civil standard was a deliberate step which Parliament considered was justified by the seriousness of the behaviour being addressed by these injunctions and the purpose of the statutory scheme, namely to prevent and protect against gang violence. [61-63] Furthermore, Parliament has incorporated into the 2009 Act and 2014 Act procedural safeguards which secure the fairness of any trial in relation to the granting of a gang injunction. [64-65]  The standard applicable to the relevant issues under the 2009 Act and the 2014 Act is therefore the civil standard. The court’s task is to determine whether on the balance of probabilities the conduct identified took place. [60]			
2023	uksc-2021-0120	Secretary of State for Transport (Appellant) v Curzon Park Ltd and others (Respondents) [2023] UKSC 30	When land is compulsorily purchased, the landowner is entitled to compensation under the Land Compensation Act 1961 (the "Act"). The basic measure of compensation is the open market value of land if sold by a willing seller. The landowner is also entitled to compensation for enhancement of the value of the land resulting from actual or prospective planning permission for its development. Under section 14 of the Act, in assessing the value of the land, account may be taken of: planning permission which is in force in respect of it at the relevant valuation date; the prospect at the valuation date of planning permission being granted in respect of it on or after that date; and 'appropriate alternative development' of the land. Development is 'appropriate alternative development' if, on stated assumptions, at the relevant valuation date planning permission for the development could reasonably have been expected to be granted on an application decided either on that date or at a time after that date. Under section 17 of the Act, the landowner may apply to the local planning authority for a certificate of appropriate alternative development ("CAAD") stating that there is development which is appropriate alternative development for the purposes of section 14.  The issue which arises on this appeal is whether, in determining an application for a CAAD for a particular parcel of land, the decision maker may take into account CAAD applications or decisions which relate to the development of other land.  The factual context in which the issue arises is the valuation of four neighbouring sites which were compulsorily acquired in 2018 by the Secretary of State for Transport in order to construct a railway terminus in Birmingham for Phase 1 of HS2 (the London to West Midlands high-speed railway). The four respondents were the owners of the sites and each of them applied for and was granted a CAAD in relation to their respective sites.  In determining the respondents' CAAD applications, Birmingham City Council considered each application in isolation, rejecting the Secretary of State's contention that the cumulative impacts of all the applications for CAADs should be considered. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal, which held that, subject to certain boundaries, it was for the decision maker to give other CAAD applications or decisions relating to other land such evidential weight as they thought appropriate. The Upper Tribunal rejected the Secretary of State's arguments that CAAD applications in respect of other sites should be treated as notional applications for planning permission and that each of the respondents was liable to be over-compensated unless the cumulative effect of development which had or was likely to come forward on neighbouring sites was taken into account.  The Secretary of State appealed to the Court of Appeal. Before the Court of Appeal, the respondents argued that section 14 of the Act requires the decision maker to assume that the scheme of development has been cancelled on the launch date (the "cancellation assumption"), and from the cancellation assumption it follows that no CAAD applications could have been made pursuant to section 17 of the Act in the counterfactual scenario posited by the statute (the "counterfactual cancelled scheme world"). As such, the respondents contended, the inevitable consequence of the cancellation assumption is that the decision maker must disregard any applications or decisions in respect of other sites which may in fact have been made. The Court of Appeal accepted this argument and held that the decision maker was not entitled to take into account other CAAD applications or decisions relating to the development of other land. The Secretary of State now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal to a limited extent, holding that the declaration made by the Upper Tribunal should be restored. Lord Sales and Lord Hamblen give the judgment, with which all the other members of the Court agree.	(1) Is taking account of CAAD applications or decisions precluded by the cancellation assumption?  Contrary to the Court of Appeal's judgment, the argument that other CAAD applications or decisions cannot be taken into account due to the cancellation assumption must be rejected. The question to be addressed is whether at the valuation date planning permission could reasonably have been expected to be granted. That question is to be determined making the assumptions required by section 14(5) of the Act but otherwise in the circumstances known to the market at the relevant valuation date. In answering that question no restriction is placed on the evidence which can or cannot be used other than that it must be circumstances known to the market. If it is, then any relevant real world evidence may be relied upon, including for example a CAAD application or decision that may have been made in relation to land other than the land in issue prior to the valuation date [60-61].  It would be odd to say that evidence which happens to exist in the real world which is capable of providing relevant assistance in answering the questions to be addressed in constructing the counterfactual cancelled scheme world under the Act should be ignored. It would require clear statutory language to produce such an effect, and there is none in the Act. So if CAAD applications or decisions are capable of being a source of relevant evidence, the Act does not preclude reference being made to them [65] .  (2) What is the relevance of other sites/proposals to the determination of planning permission applications?  The ways in which other sites or proposals may be relevant to the determination of a planning permission application include: where alternative sites exist which it is reasonable to expect may be developed or brought forward for development within a reasonable time, and which through their development might satisfy a particular need in the public interest at less cost to other aspects of the public interest as compared to the development of the site in question; where the cumulative effects of multiple proposals is adverse to some aspect of the public interest; and where the proposed type of development on particular land would be incompatible with the grant of planning permission for other forms of development on neighbouring land [67]. Other sites or proposals may also be relevant in relation to the principle of consistency in public law decision-making [68].  (3) How should the counterfactual cancelled scheme world be constructed as at the valuation date?  When constructing the counterfactual cancelled scheme world, it is clear from the language of section 14 that it is not legitimate to consider whether planning permission for development either for the land in issue or for any other land might have been granted in the notional period between the deemed cancellation of the scheme on the launch date and the valuation date. In the case of planning permissions which exist in the real world, the relevant date to see if there are any in force is the valuation date. In the case of assessing the prospect of the grant of planning permission for the land in issue or other land, this involves looking at the circumstances as known to the market at the valuation date. In both cases, no speculation about the notional period between the cancellation date and the valuation date is authorised. The same is true in relation to assessing whether the test for appropriate alternative development is satisfied [74].  Section 14 is drafted so as to specify a reasonably certain process of assessment of the value of the land in issue, focusing on circumstances as they actually exist (subject to the cancellation assumption) at the valuation date and based on an objective set of circumstances as known to the market at that date [76].  (4) Are CAAD applications and decisions distinct from applications for and grants of planning permission? Is a CAAD application or decision a material planning consideration?  The Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal were right to conclude that a CAAD application is not equivalent to an application for planning permission in the real world and that a decision to grant a CAAD is not equivalent to the grant of planning permission in the real world. The CAAD regime exists only as a mechanism to assist with the assessment of the value of the land in issue in the counterfactual cancelled scheme world for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation which is payable in respect of it [77]. Neither a CAAD application nor a decision to grant a CAAD are material planning considerations. They play no role whatever in the real planning world [78].  Accordingly, the grant of a CAAD does not have the effect of meeting a planning need for a particular type of development in the real world or in the counterfactual cancelled scheme world [81].  (5) May account be taken of evidential material contained in a CAAD application?  In the determination of a CAAD application, in so far as it is relevant, the local planning authority (and the Upper Tribunal) is entitled to refer to the pack of material submitted in support of a CAAD application for other land and to treat it as a readily available source of evidence bearing upon the application of the test for whether development is appropriate alternative development. The local planning authority has to bear in mind that the other CAAD application is not to be treated as if it were itself an application for planning permission in respect of the other land, and can only draw upon the material submitted in support of that application to the extent that it casts light upon the circumstances known to the market at the valuation date for the land in issue [85].  (6) Can CAAD applications or decisions relating to land other than the land in issue be relevant and taken into account, and if so in what circumstances?  CAAD applications in respect of other land, along with the material submitted in support of them, may have some relevance in showing how the market would expect landowners holding land ripe for development to seek to develop their land. Such landowners would be expected to act to maximise their returns by focusing development proposals for their land on the most profitable forms of development likely to be appropriate for the area in question. Similarly, landowners who make CAAD applications are likely for ordinary reasons of self-interest to press for a CAAD for patterns of development which would reflect the highest contribution to the value of their land. Accordingly, if the CAAD applications in relation to plots of land in the same general area revealed a pattern in terms of the development sought to be reflected in the CAADs, that could provide some evidence to show how market actors would have been likely to respond to known market circumstances at the valuation date for the land in issue in the counterfactual cancelled scheme world [92].  Information in CAAD applications and information in planning applications in the real world are both forms of real world information. The former is information derived from the behaviour of landowners in the real world of making applications to seek compensation under the Act. The extent to which information in a CAAD application or information from planning applications in the real world provide material capable of providing analogies relevant to an assessment of such matters for the purposes of the construction of the counterfactual cancelled scheme world will depend on how closely the circumstances in each case are comparable. This would be a matter for the assessment of the local planning authority (or the Upper Tribunal, as the case may be), subject to the usual constraints imposed by general public law [93].  Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed to the limited extent indicated. The declaration made by the Upper Tribunal should be restored [100].			
2023	uksc-2021-0125	R (on the application of Wang and another) (Respondents) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Appellant) [2023] UKSC 21	This appeal relates to the interpretation of the Immigration Rules, in particular the Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant regime (as in force in December 2017 - it has since been closed). This regime was designed to grant leave to remain to high-net-worth individuals making a substantial financial contribution to the UK. To qualify individuals were required to have Â£1 million (of either their own money or money borrowed from a UK-regulated financial institution) under their control in the UK. They must also have invested at least Â£750,000 of such sum in the UK through UK Government bonds or in shares in or loans to active and trading UK-registered companies (subject to certain further restrictions and exclusions).  Ms Wang is an individual who (among over 100 others) subscribed to a scheme designed to ensure qualification for leave to remain under the Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant regime. Under this scheme Ms Wang borrowed the necessary Â£1 million from Maxwell Asset Management Ltd ("MAM", a UK-regulated financial institution). This was on terms that it was required to be used for investment in shares in or loans to active and trading UK-registered companies.  Ms Wang also signed a "services agreement" with a company called Maxwell Holdings Ltd ("Holdings"). Under this agreement Holdings was to provide services including advising on the Tier 1 regime requirements and ensuring that monies were used for authorised investments. To do this Holdings was to have discretion as to how to invest the monies loaned by MAM on behalf of Ms Wang and to act on behalf of Ms Wang under a power of attorney. Holdings also guaranteed repayments of the loan to MAM, and agreed to make all interest payments under the loan to MAM at no expense to Ms Wang. In return for this Ms Wang paid a fee of Â£200,000, which was repayable if she did not obtain Tier 1 (Investor) migrant status.  The Â£1 million was then invested on behalf of Ms Wang (as with all the participants in the scheme) in a company called Eclectic Capital Limited ("Eclectic") by way of a loan which was convertible to shares at Eclectic's election (which would pay a dividend lower than the interest rate on the loan from MAM). The loan funds were transferred directly from MAM to Eclectic, which invested the money almost exclusively in Russian companies.  Each of MAM, Holdings and Eclectic were wholly owned and controlled by two Russian nationals, Dimitry Petrovich Kirpichenko and his wife Nika Kirpichenko.  In 2017 Ms Wang applied for leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant on the basis of her participation in this scheme. The Secretary of State refused Ms Wang's application on two grounds: (1) that the loan from MAM did not result in her having the Â£1 million "under [her] control" because she had no choice about where to invest the money; and (2) that the investment in Eclectic was not a qualifying investment because it was an excluded type of company. This decision was upheld following an administrative review within the Home Office.  Ms Wang then applied for judicial review. This was dismissed by the Upper Tribunal. However, that decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal, which allowed Ms Wang's appeal and set aside the Secretary of State's decision. The Secretary of State appealed to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and restores the Secretary of State's decision to refuse Ms Wang's application for leave to remain. Lord Briggs gives the only judgment, with which the other members of the panel agree.	The principal question for the Supreme Court was whether the Â£1 million loaned to Ms Wang was "money under [her] control" within the meaning of the Immigration Rules.  The Supreme Court explained that the Immigration Rules are to be interpreted in light of their context and purpose, in accordance with the general principles of statutory interpretation [29]-[31]. In applying the rules the court must take an unblinkered and realistic approach to analysing the facts. In a case such as this, that includes considering the relevant scheme in question as a whole or "in the round" [2]-[7];[31]. That was the case even though the Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant regime was a points-based or "tick-box" system which sacrifices discretion and perfect fairness for efficiency, transparency and predictability [32]-[35].  Following this approach the Supreme Court considered that the Secretary of State had correctly interpreted "under [her] control" as requiring that an applicant has a real choice about the use and disposition of the relevant money [47]. The Court of Appeal had erred in interpreting the requirement as only being that the money be available to Ms Wang personally as opposed to as a nominee. This was because the requirement of the money to be "of [her] own" would already exclude nominees, and so render "under [her] control" redundant and emasculate its natural and ordinary meaning [42]-[46].  Looking at the terms, commercial rationale, and practical operation of the Maxwell scheme in the round, the Supreme Court agreed with the Secretary of State (and the courts below) that Ms Wang did not have any real choice about the use of the loaned money. It was pre-ordained by the scheme that the Â£1 million would be invested in Eclectic (or possibly some other company owned and controlled by Mr and Mrs Kirpichenko). Any choice lay with Mr and Mrs Kirpichenko and the companies they controlled not Ms Wang [48]-[51].  The Secretary of State was therefore right to conclude that Ms Wang did not have the money "under [her] control" for the purposes of the Immigration Rules. The appeal is therefore allowed and the Secretary of State's decision to refuse leave to remain is restored [52];[55].  It was not therefore necessary for the Supreme Court to consider the Secretary of State's second reason for refusing leave to remain (i.e. that the investment in Eclectic was not a qualifying investment) [53]-[54].			
2023	uksc-2021-0138	London Borough of Merton Council (Appellant) v Nuffield Health (Respondent) [2023] UKSC 18 On appeal from: [2021] EWCA Civ 826	Section 43(5) and (6)(a) of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 ("the LGFA") provides for a mandatory 80% relief from business rates where "the ratepayer is a charity or trustees for a charity" and the premises are "wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes (whether of that charity or of that and other charities)". In this appeal, the Supreme Court is asked to decide whether the respondent, Nuffield Health, is entitled to this mandatory 80% relief in respect of its members-only gym known as Merton Abbey.  Nuffield Health is a registered charity whose purposes are "to advance, promote and maintain health and healthcare of all descriptions and to prevent, relieve and cure sickness and ill health of any kind, all for the public benefit." It pursues those purposes primarily through the provision of gym facilities, including the gym at Merton Abbey. It also operates private hospitals and clinics. The facilities at the Merton Abbey gym are mainly restricted to fee-paying Nuffield Health gym members. In April 2019, the standard membership fee was £80 per month (or £71 per month for those who committed to a longer period of membership). Nuffield Health offers certain services to non-members through the Merton Abbey gym, but these are limited.  Nuffield Health claimed the mandatory 80% relief from business rates under section 43(5) and (6)(a) of the LGFA from 1 August 2016, when it acquired the Merton Abbey gym from Virgin Active. The appellant rating authority, London Borough of Merton Council ("the Council") refused the relief because the membership fees were set at a level which excluded persons of modest means from enjoying the gym facilities. In the Council’s view, this meant that the Merton Abbey gym was not used for charitable purposes because the requirement for public benefit was not satisfied.  Nuffield Health challenged this decision and succeeded, both in the High Court and, by a majority, in the Court of Appeal. The Council appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the Council’s appeal. It holds that Nuffield Health uses the Merton Abbey gym for its charitable purposes. Nuffield Health is therefore entitled to the mandatory 80% relief from business rates under section 43(5) and (6)(a) of the LGFA with effect from 1 August 2016. Lord Briggs and Lord Sales give a joint judgment with which the other members of the Court agree.	The Supreme Court holds that section 43(5) and (6)(a) of the LGFA imposes two conditions for entitlement to the mandatory 80% relief from business rates, to be tested by a two-stage enquiry [49].  The first condition is that the ratepayer is a charity or trustees for a charity. At this stage of the enquiry, the rating authority should first consider whether the ratepayer is a registered charity. If it is, the first condition will be satisfied since, by section 37(1) of the Charities Act 2011 ("the 2011 Act"), the ratepayer is conclusively presumed to be a charity [22], [49], [52]. However, if the ratepayer is not registered, the rating authority should consider whether it meets the test for charitable status. This is a question of charity law [52]. To qualify as a charity, a ratepayer must be established for exclusively charitable purposes. That is, for purposes which fall within section 3(1) of the 2011 Act and are for the public benefit as defined in section 4 [22]-[25]. These purposes should ordinarily be identified by reference to the ratepayer’s written constitution. However, if the ratepayer does not have a written constitution, or the constitution is inconclusive, they can be determined by a review of the ratepayer’s activities and the purposes they serve. In considering whether the requirements of section 4 are satisfied, one looks at the ratepayer’s activities as a whole, not just as carried on at any one particular site [24], [30]-[31], [49], [56].  The second condition is that the premises in question are used wholly or mainly for the charitable purposes of the ratepayer, or of the ratepayer and other particular charities. At this stage of the enquiry, the rating authority is required to consider how the premises are, in fact, being used. In contrast with stage one, this is a question of fact, not a question of charity law. If the premises are being used for the (necessarily charitable) purposes of the charity or for incidental activities which are sufficiently closely connected with those purposes, then the second condition will be satisfied. In contrast, if the premises are used for activities which are not sufficiently closely connected with the charity’s purposes (such as fundraising or investment), then the second condition will not be met. The same is true if the activities are conducted in breach of the trustees’ fiduciary duties and not in pursuit of the charity’s purposes [43], [50]-[52].  The Supreme Court holds that both of the conditions set out in section 43(5) and (6)(a) of the LGFA are satisfied on the facts of this case. Nuffield Health is a registered charity and therefore meets the first condition. Even if the services provided at the Merton Abbey gym do not, taken by themselves, satisfy the public benefit test in section 4 of the 2011 Act, Nuffield Health’s purposes are exclusively charitable in all the places where they are carried on and, viewed as a whole, satisfy the public benefit test in that section. The second condition is also met because Nuffield Health uses the Merton Abbey gym for the direct fulfilment of its charitable purpose of promoting health through exercise [44], [63]-[64]. Both the rich and the poor form part of the section of the public served by this purpose. Accordingly, Merton Abbey is used for charitable purposes, because the provision of gym facilities to those who can afford to pay the membership fees is itself carried out as part of the public benefit requirement [26]-[29], [64].  The parties agree that the Nuffield Health’s trustees are not in breach of their fiduciary duties. It must therefore be assumed that people of modest means are not excluded from benefitting from Nuffield Health’s activities overall, even if they are excluded from the facilities at Merton Abbey gym. It follows that Nuffield Health is entitled to the mandatory 80% relief from business rates [64]-[65].			
2023	uksc-2021-0139	Canada Square Operations Ltd (Appellant) v Potter (Respondent)	The Limitation Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act”) sets out the time limits (or limitation periods) for bringing different kinds of legal claims. Section 32(1)(b) postpones the commencement of the ordinary limitation period where any fact relevant to the claimant’s right of action has been “deliberately concealed” from them by the defendant. Section 32(2) provides that, for the purposes of section 32(1), “deliberate commission of a breach of duty in circumstances in which it is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in that breach of duty.” In this appeal, the Supreme Court is asked to clarify the meaning of the phrases “deliberately concealed” in section 32(1)(b) and “deliberate commission of a breach of duty” in section 32(2), so as to determine whether Mrs Potter’s claim against the defendant, Canada Square Operations Ltd (“Canada Square”), was issued too late and is therefore time barred. The meaning of “deliberate commission of a breach of duty” in section 32(2) is also considered in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Primeo Fund v Bank of Bermuda (Cayman) Ltd [2023] UKPC 40, handed down on the same date as the judgment in the present case. On 26 July 2006, Mrs Potter entered into an agreement with Canada Square, then known as Egg Banking plc. The agreement was a credit agreement within the meaning of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (“the 1974 Act”). Mrs Potter borrowed £20,787.24 from Canada Square, comprising a cash loan of £16,953.00 and a payment protection premium of £3,834.24 (“the premium”). The premium related to Mrs Potter’s purchase of a payment protection insurance policy (“the PPI Policy”), which Canada Square arranged on her behalf. Over 95% of the premium was paid to Canada Square as commission on the sale of the PPI Policy. The sum paid to the insurer was only £182.50. Canada Square did not tell Mrs Potter about the commission. The agreement ended on 8 March 2010. On 14 December 2018, Mrs Potter issued a claim against Canada Square, seeking to recover the amounts she had paid to Canada Square in respect of the PPI Policy, plus interest. Mrs Potter claimed that Canada Square’s failure to disclose the substantial commission charged on the PPI Policy rendered the relationship between them “unfair” within the meaning of section 140A of the 1974 Act. She was therefore entitled to apply for the remedial orders set out in section 140B. Canada Square argued that it was too late for Mrs Potter to bring her claim, because section 9 of the 1980 Act imposed a six-year limitation period which had long expired. Relying on section 32, Mrs Potter contended that her claim was not time barred because the limitation period did not start to run until she found out about the commission after taking legal advice in November 2018. The County Court held that section 32 applied, and therefore found for Mrs Potter. Canada Square’s appeals to the High Court and the Court of Appeal were unsuccessful. The Court of Appeal held that both section 32(1)(b) and section 32(2) operated to postpone the commencement of the six-year limitation period, so Mrs Potter’s claim is not time barred. Canada Square now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Canada Square’s appeal. It holds that Mrs Potter’s claim is not time barred. This is because section 32(1)(b) of the 1980 Act postponed the commencement of the six-year limitation period until November 2018, when Mrs Potter was advised that the premium was likely to have included substantial commission. However, Canada Square’s failure to disclose the commission was not a deliberate breach of duty for the purposes of section 32(2), so the Court of Appeal was wrong to hold that Canada Square was also deprived of a limitation defence by the operation of that section. Lord Reed gives the judgment, with which the other members of the Court agree.	Issue 1: Did Canada Square deliberately conceal a fact relevant to Mrs Potter’s right of action so that so that section 32(1)(b) of the 1980 Act postponed the commencement of the ordinary six-year limitation period for bringing her claim? A claimant who wishes to rely on section 32(1)(b) to defeat a Limitation Act defence must prove that there was a fact relevant to the claimant’s right of action, which was deliberately concealed from her by the defendant. In this appeal, the Supreme Court is asked to clarify the meaning of the words “deliberately” and “concealed” in this context. Beginning with the meaning of “concealed”, the Supreme Court holds that a fact will have been concealed if the defendant has kept it secret from the claimant, either by taking active steps to hide it or by failing to disclose it. Contrary to previous Court of Appeal authority, the claimant does not need to establish that the defendant was under a legal, moral or social duty to disclose the fact, nor does she need to show that the defendant knew the fact was relevant to the claimant’s right of action. All that is required is that the defendant deliberately ensures that the claimant does not know about the fact in question and so cannot bring proceedings within the ordinary time limit [67], [98]-[105], [109]. Turning to the meaning of “deliberately”, the Supreme Court holds that the defendant’s concealment of a relevant fact will be deliberate if the defendant intended to conceal the fact in question. The Court rejects the Court of Appeal’s finding that “deliberately” can also mean “recklessly” in this context [106]-[109]. Applying this to the facts of the case, the existence and amount of Canada Square’s commission on the PPI Policy were facts which were relevant to Mrs Potter’s right of action under section 140A of the 1974 Act, since she could not plead her case without knowing them. Canada Square deliberately concealed these facts from Mrs Potter by consciously deciding not to tell her about the commission. Section 140A was not in force when Canada Square initially decided not to disclose the commission. However, Canada Square continued to withhold the information from Mrs Potter after section 140A was brought into force, even though the agreement between Mrs Potter and Canada Square remained in force and the commission continued to be paid. Mrs Potter did not find out about the commission until November 2018, shortly before she issued her claim against Canada Square. There is no suggestion that, with reasonable diligence, she could have discovered the concealment any earlier. Accordingly, the requirements of section 32(1)(b) of the 1980 Act are met [154]. This means that Mrs Potter’s claim against Canada Square is not time barred, because section 32(1)(b) of the 1980 Act postponed the commencement of the ordinary six-year limitation period for bringing her claim until November 2018. Issue 2: Did Canada Square’s conduct amount to a deliberate commission of a breach of duty for the purposes of section 32(2) of the 1980 Act? The Court of Appeal concluded that the creation of an unfair relationship within the meaning of section 140A of the 1974 Act amounted to a breach of duty by Canada Square for the purposes of section 32(2) of the 1980 Act. The issue before the Supreme Court is whether that breach of duty was deliberate. The Supreme Court holds that a claimant who wishes to rely on section 32(2) must show that the defendant knew it was committing a breach of duty or intended to commit a breach of duty [153], [155]. It rejects the submission that “deliberate” includes “reckless” so that a defendant could be said to commit a breach of duty deliberately if it realised that there was a risk that what it was doing might be a breach of duty and took that risk in circumstances where it was objectively unreasonable for it to do so, for four reasons. First, “deliberate” and “reckless” have different ordinary meanings and are used to mean different things in both judicial decisions and legislation [112]-[122]. Secondly, the case law supports the view that that recklessness is not sufficient to establish a deliberate breach of duty for the purposes of section 32(2) [123]-[133]. Thirdly, section 32 should not be construed as a restatement of the old law of concealed fraud [134]-[144]. Fourthly, interpreting “deliberate” to include “reckless” would be likely to result in practical problems [151]-[152]. Applying this to the facts, it has not been shown that Canada Square knew or intended that its failure to disclose the commission to Mrs Potter would render their relationship unfair within the meaning of section 140A of the 1974 Act. Accordingly, Canada Square’s breach of duty was not deliberate. This means that Mrs Potter cannot rely on section 32(2) of the 1980 Act to postpone the commencement of the ordinary six-year limitation period for bringing her claim [155].			
2023	uksc-2021-0144	JTI POLSKA Sp. Z o.o. and others (Respondents) v Jakubowski and others (Appellants)	The appellants are road hauliers based in Poland. The respondents are part of a group of companies that buy and sell tobacco products internationally. The respondents contracted the appellants to transport a consignment of cigarettes from Poland to England. The road carriage was undertaken subject to the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road 1956 (the "CMR"), an international treaty which widely governs international transport by road and has the force of law in the UK under domestic legislation. Under a European excise duty suspension arrangement, excise duty on the cigarettes was suspended until such time as the consignment was released for commercial consumption, or was deemed to have been released for commercial consumption, as in the case of non-delivery or partial delivery due to theft.  During transit, whilst the driver's vehicle was parked in a motorway service station in England, thieves stole 289 cases of cigarettes with a market value of £72,512. As a result of the theft, the respondents incurred an excise duty of £449,557 as the cigarettes were deemed to have been released for commercial consumption in the UK.  The respondents claimed compensation from the appellants under the CMR. The parties settled the claim save as to the excise duty, which the respondents claimed under article 23.4 of the CMR. Article 23.4 provides that, in the case of the loss of goods, a cargo claimant may claim "carriage charges, Customs duties and other charges incurred in respect of the carriage of the goods", in addition to the value of the goods. Courts in states that are parties to the CMR have interpreted the phrase "other charges incurred in respect of the carriage of the goods" in two main ways. The ‘broad interpretation' is that it encompasses charges incurred because of the way that the goods were actually carried and lost, so that the cargo claimant can recover excise duty levied on goods lost in transit. The ‘narrow interpretation' is that it is limited to those charges which would have been incurred if the carriage had been performed without incident, and so excludes such excise duty. In James Buchanan & Co. Ltd v Babco Forwarding & Shipping (UK) Ltd. [1978] AC 141 ("Buchanan"), the House of Lords decided by a 3:2 majority that the broad interpretation should be adopted.  Before the High Court, the appellants accepted that following Buchanan the Judge was bound to hold that the excise duty was recoverable, but they contended that the decision was wrong and should be departed from. They therefore applied for a certificate to appeal directly to the Supreme Court. The Judge granted the certificate and the Supreme Court subsequently granted permission to appeal.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal, holding that the Court should not depart from the House of Lords' decision in Buchanan pursuant to the Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) [1966] 1 WLR 1234 (the "Practice Statement"). Lord Hamblen gives the judgment, with which all the other members of the Court agree.	The approach to interpretation of the CMR  Buchanan remains a leading authority on the proper approach to the interpretation of international treaties in general and the CMR in particular. The correct approach is to interpret the text on broad principles that are generally accepted. The expressed objective of the CMR is to produce uniformity in all contracting states, and the Court should try to harmonise interpretation if possible. It is appropriate to have regard to the case law of other contracting states [22].  Since Buchanan was decided, there has been increasing recognition by English courts of the role of the rules of interpretation set out in articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 (the "Vienna Convention") [23]. Article 31 focuses on seeking to ascertain the ordinary meaning of the relevant terms of the treaty, having regard to their context and the object and purpose of the treaty [26]. Article 32 then allows for recourse to be had to supplementary material including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion [28].  There is no published preparatory work for the CMR. Nevertheless, the appellants have sought to put together documents which they say should be regarded as the preparatory work [33]. It is doubtful that those documents can assist as they do not identify a common intention or understanding of the states that are parties to the CMR [35-36].  The 1966 Practice Statement  In the Practice Statement it was resolved that while House of Lords decisions (and now Supreme Court judgments) will be normally binding, they can be departed from when it appears right to do so [37]. It is not possible to be categorical about when the Supreme Court will invoke the Practice Statement and depart from an earlier decision, but examples include: where previous decisions were generally thought to be impeding the proper development of the law or to have led to results which were unjust or contrary to public policy; where they have created uncertainty in the law; where there has been a material change in circumstances; and, in the context of an international trade law treaty, where a decision has been demonstrated to work unsatisfactorily in the market place and to produce manifestly unjust results [40]. There is less scope for reconsideration of a decision involving a question of interpretation, whether of a statute or other document, than one involving a common law rule. One reason for this is that interpretation is a matter of impression in relation to which it will rarely be possible to say that one view is demonstrably right or wrong [41]. It will always be necessary to do more than to persuade the present panel of Justices that the prior decision is wrong [42]. A previous decision on interpretation will not be departed from if it reflects a tenable view [43].  The appellants' case  The principal reasons why the appellants contended that it is appropriate to depart from Buchanan are: (i) there are a number of decisions in other CMR jurisdictions which have adopted the narrow interpretation [70-71]; (ii) academic criticism of Buchanan [53-58]; (iii) criticism of Buchanan in the Court of Appeal decision in Sandeman Coprimar SA v Transitos Intergrales SL [2003] EWCA Civ 113 ("Sandeman") [63-67]; (iv) the ordinary meaning of "other charges", the context, the object and purpose of the CMR in general and of the liability provisions in chapter IV in particular [76-85]; (v) the preparatory work for the CMR [86-87]; and (vi) the fact that the narrow interpretation applies under the related convention covering the international carriage of goods by rail (the "CIM") [88-91].  Is the broad interpretation tenable?  There are powerful arguments in favour of the narrow interpretation. In particular, there is considerable force in the arguments based on the object and purpose of chapter IV of the CMR, in which article 23.4 is located, and on the structure of the compensation scheme for loss of goods under the CMR [98]. However, the broad interpretation is tenable. This is supported by the fact that it reflects the conclusion of the judges at all levels in Buchanan (other than the minority in the House of Lords) and that reached by the Supreme Courts of Denmark, The Czech Republic, Lithuania and (arguably) Belgium, as well as the Italian Court of Appeal [99].  It is also supported by the reasoning of the majority in Buchanan [100]. As to ordinary meaning, the relevant wording is widely drawn. The words "in respect of" are commonly understood as equating to "in connection with". As a matter of language, it is very difficult to say that a loss which occurs during the course of road carriage and as a result of the way in which that carriage is performed is not connected with that carriage [101]. There is also force in the argument that the wording of article 23.4 is different to that in article 6.1(i) of the CMR, which refers to charges "incurred from the making of the contract to the time of delivery", a formulation which can be more readily understood to refer to charges incurred for the purpose of carriage in line with the narrow interpretation – that formulation was not used in article 23.4 [102]. Some of the criticisms of the broad interpretation are also unjustified or overstated [103].  Is this an appropriate case for the Court to exercise its power under the Practice Statement?  The appellants argued that uncertainty in the law has arisen following the decision in Sandeman in which the Court of Appeal stated that Buchanan should not be applied any more widely than respect for the doctrine of precedent requires. However, any resulting uncertainty arises from that statement in Sandeman, which was inappropriate and should not be followed, and not from Buchanan itself [113]. The appellants also argued that there had been a material change in circumstances given: the Sandeman decision; academic disapproval of Buchanan; German and Swedish Supreme Court decisions upholding the narrow interpretation; and the emergence of a settled view in relation to the same issue when it arises under the CIM [115].  None of these arguments were persuasive. Sandeman's disapproval of Buchanan was inappropriate. Academic disapproval is not unanimous and in any event is somewhat muted and is not in itself a material change. The German and Swedish Supreme Court decisions have to be balanced against contrary decisions reached in other jurisdictions; there is no international consensus. The emergence of a settled view under the CIM was achieved through amendment to that treaty. That may be a reason for the parties to the CMR convening to consider making a similar amendment, but it does not inform the proper interpretation of article 23.4 [116]. It has not been shown that the Buchanan decision works unsatisfactorily in the market place [117], nor is it suggested that Buchanan produces manifestly unjust results [118]. This is not an appropriate case for the Court to exercise its power under the Practice Statement and so depart from Buchanan.  While it is desirable that there be a uniform view as to the proper interpretation of article 23.4, reversing Buchanan would not achieve that, as the broad interpretation either is or may be followed in many other countries. In order to achieve uniformity, it would be necessary to amend article 23.4 to the CMR. That, however, is a matter for the parties to the CMR [120].			
2023	uksc-2021-0149	McCulloch and others (Appellants) v Forth Valley Health Board (Respondent) (Scotland) [2023] UKSC 26 	This case is concerned with the extent to which a doctor is required, under the duty of care owed to a patient, to inform the patient about alternative possible treatments to the one that is being recommended.  In Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board [2015] UKSC 11 ("Montgomery"), the Supreme Court held that a doctor is under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments.  Following that decision, the main issue in this case is what test should be applied when assessing whether an alternative treatment is reasonable and requires to be discussed with the patient. More specifically, does a doctor fall below the required standard of reasonable care by failing to make a patient aware of an alternative treatment in a situation where the doctor's opinion was that the alternative treatment was not reasonable, and that opinion was supported by a responsible body of medical opinion (thus complying with what is sometimes referred to as the ‘professional practice test' set out in Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582 at 587 ("Bolam") and in the Scottish case of Hunter v Hanley 1955 SC 200 at 206 ("Hunter"))?  The facts of the case are as follows. On 23 March 2012, Mr McCulloch, aged 39, was admitted to the Forth Valley Royal Hospital complaining of chest pains, nausea and vomiting. Dr Labinjoh, a consultant cardiologist at the hospital, was asked to review an echocardiogram that had been performed on Mr McCulloch. Her review of Mr McCulloch indicated that his presentation did not fit with a standard diagnosis of pericarditis (an inflammation close to the heart). During the next few days, Mr McCulloch's condition improved. On 30 March, he was discharged home on antibiotics.  A couple of days later Mr McCulloch was readmitted to hospital complaining of the reoccurrence of chest pain. He was given intravenous fluids and antibiotics under the care of the medical team. On 2 April, a nursing entry stated ‘Nil further chest pain'. The next day, Dr Labinjoh visited Mr McCulloch in the Acute Admissions Unit, having reviewed a further echocardiogram. He looked much better than when she had previously seen him and, in answer to her questions, he denied having any chest pain. That being the case, she saw no reason to prescribe any additional medical treatment. In her professional judgement, she did not regard it as appropriate to prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ("NSAIDs"), such as ibuprofen, because Mr McCulloch was not in pain at the time she saw him and there was no clear diagnosis of pericarditis.  On 6 April, Mr McCulloch was discharged home and remained on antibiotics. On 7 April he suffered a cardiac arrest at home from which he died.  His widow and other family members brought an action against Forth Valley Health Board alleging that they were vicariously liable for Mr McCulloch's death, which they say was caused by negligent treatment by Dr Labinjoh. They alleged that Dr Labinjoh was in breach of her duty of care by failing to inform Mr McCulloch that NSAIDs were a possible treatment option for him. It is alleged that had he been so advised he would have taken a NSAID and would not have died.  The expert evidence indicated that, while some doctors would have prescribed NSAIDs to Mr McCulloch, there was also a responsible body of medical opinion that supported Dr Labinjoh's approach given that Mr McCulloch was not in pain and there was no clear diagnosis of pericarditis.  The Lord Ordinary and the Inner House held that Dr Labinjoh was not negligent in failing to inform Mr McCulloch about the possible treatment by NSAIDs. The widow and family members of Mr McCulloch appealed to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. The judgment is given by Lord Hamblen and Lord Burrows with whom Lord Reed, Lord Hodge and Lord Kitchin agree.	The correct test to decide what is a reasonable alternative treatment is what can be referred to as the ‘professional practice test' which is set out in Bolam in England and Wales and Hunter in Scotland. A doctor who has taken the view that a treatment is not a reasonable alternative treatment for a particular patient will not be negligent in failing to inform the patient of that alternative treatment if the doctor's view is supported by a responsible of body of medical opinion [56].  Taking a hypothetical example to help explain, in more detail, how the court regards the law as working: a doctor will first seek to provide a diagnosis (which may initially be a provisional diagnosis) having, for example, examined the patient, conducted tests, and having had discussions with the patient. Say that, in respect of that diagnosis, there are ten possible treatment options; the doctor, exercising his or her clinical judgment, decides that only four of them are reasonable and that decision to rule out six is supported by a responsible body of medical opinion. The doctor is not negligent by failing to inform the patient about the other six even though they are possible alternative treatments. The narrowing down from possible alternative treatments to reasonable alternative treatments is an exercise of clinical judgment to which the professional practice test should be applied. The duty of reasonable care would then require the doctor to inform the patient not only of the treatment option that the doctor is recommending but also of the other three reasonable alternative treatment options (plus no treatment if that is a reasonable alternative option) indicating their respective advantages and disadvantages and the material risks involved in each treatment option [57].  It was submitted by counsel for the appellants that the professional practice test was not the correct test to apply and that it is for the court to determine what are the reasonable alternative treatments about which the patient should be informed. But the Supreme Court rejects that submission for a number of reasons including: (i) consistency with what was said in Montgomery [59-62]; (ii) consistency with the two stage test set out in the Court of Appeal decision in Duce v Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust [2018] EWCA Civ 1307 [63-66]; (iii) consistency with medical expertise and guidance [67-70]; (iv) avoiding an unfortunate conflict in the doctor's role – in the sense that acceptance of the submission might lead to a doctor having to inform the patient about a treatment that the doctor, supported by a responsible body of medical opinion, considers to be clinically inappropriate for the patient [71]; (v) avoiding bombarding the patient with information [72-73]; and (vi) avoiding making the law uncertain for doctors who have to apply it [74-77]. In essence, the Supreme Court rejects the submission of the appellants because it would constitute an unwarranted extension of the law on the duty of care to inform that was laid down in the Montgomery case.  Applying that law to the facts of this case, Dr Labinjoh was not negligent because her view, that prescribing NSAIDs for Mr McCulloch was not a reasonable treatment option for him because he was not in pain and there was no clear diagnosis of pericarditis, was supported by a responsible body of medical opinion. She was therefore not in breach of her duty of care by not informing him of that possible option.			
2023	uksc-2021-0152	Popoviciu (Respondent) v Curtea De Apel Bucharest (Romania) (Appellant)	In 2016, Gabriel Popoviciu was convicted in the Bucharest Court of Appeal of offences relating to a conspiracy to transfer a plot of land from state ownership to a private company in which he had an interest. He was sentenced to 7 years’ imprisonment. On 3 August 2017, a European Arrest Warrant was issued by the Bucharest Court of Appeal seeking the return of Mr Popoviciu to serve his sentence. He was arrested in the UK on 14 August 2017 and on 12 July 2019, Westminster Magistrates’ Court ordered his extradition. Mr Popoviciu appealed to the High Court. At this stage, he brought evidence alleging that there was an improper and corrupt relationship between Judge Tudoran, who had presided at Mr Popoviciu’s criminal trial, and a key prosecution witness. On the basis of this evidence, the High Court held that there were substantial grounds for believing there was a real risk that Mr Popoviciu’s trial was so flagrantly unfair that his right to liberty under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘the Convention’) would be violated if he were returned to Romania. The High Court discharged Mr Popoviciu and quashed the order made by the Magistrates’ Court. Having done so, the High Court certified that its decision involved a point of law of general public importance about the standard of proof in cases where a person alleges that extradition would violate their human rights because the trial where they were convicted was flagrantly unfair. The point it certified was: ‘In a conviction extradition case, is it sufficient for the requested person to show substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk that his trial was so flagrantly unfair as to deprive him of the essence of his article 6 rights, and therefore a real risk that his imprisonment in the requesting state will violate his article 5 rights?’ The Romanian authorities appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.	On 26 May 2023, soon after the Supreme Court heard the appeal, the Bucharest Court of Appeal suspended the execution of Mr Popoviciu’s conviction and sentence. On 13 July 2023, the Supreme Court was informed by the designated authority that the European Arrest Warrant had been withdrawn. The Supreme Court made an order dismissing the Romanian authorities’ appeal pursuant to section 43(4) of the Extradition Act 2003. The Court nevertheless decided to deliver its judgment, to answer the question that had been certified by the High Court, and to address other issues which had been raised in the appeal.	As the European Arrest Warrant had been withdrawn following the hearing of the appeal, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal by the Romanian authorities, in accordance with section 43(4) of the Extradition Act 2003. The Supreme Court holds that the High Court misdirected itself and applied the wrong standard of proof when it decided the case. Mr Popoviciu had to show that the allegations of bias and corruption that he made against Judge Tudoran were true on the balance of probabilities, rather than showing merely that there were substantial grounds for believing that there was a real risk that they were true. Where a requested person alleges that they have been convicted in a trial that was so flagrantly unfair that it deprived them of the essence of their right to a fair trial under Article 6, and that accordingly extradition would violate their right to liberty under Article 5, they have to prove on the balance of probabilities that the trial was flagrantly unfair, subject to an exception for cases involving evidence obtained by torture [78]. The Supreme Court also explains that, if the European Arrest Warrant had not been withdrawn, it would have remitted the case to the High Court to decide a specific issue. When the matter was first before the High Court, the Romanian authorities relied upon evidence stating that even if the undisclosed relationship between Judge Tudoran and the prosecution witness were proven, it would not constitute a reason to review a final decision under Romanian legislation [30]. This raised the issue of whether there would be an effective remedy for Mr Popoviciu to challenge the lawfulness of his detention in Romania if he were extradited, as required by Article 5(4) of the Convention [104]-[105]. The experts subsequently relied upon by each party disagreed about whether there was an effective remedy under Romanian law that would allow Mr Popoviciu to challenge his conviction and the fairness of the criminal proceedings. If the European Arrest Warrant had not been withdrawn, the Supreme Court would therefore have remitted this issue to be decided by the High Court, where the parties’ experts could be cross-examined [108].			
2023	uksc-2021-0155	Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (Appellant) v Central Arbitration Committee and another (Respondents)	This appeal concerns the collective bargaining rights of a group of Deliveroo riders working in the Camden and Kentish Town area of London. These riders became members of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (“the IWGB”). In November 2016, the IWGB made a formal request to Deliveroo to recognise the union for collective bargaining on behalf of riders in Camden and Kentish Town. Deliveroo rejected this request, and the IWGB made an application to the Central Arbitration Committee (“the CAC”) under Schedule A1 to the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). This schedule sets out the procedure to be followed when an employer does not agree to recognise and bargain with a union. The procedure does not oblige the employer to conclude a collective agreement with a recognised union, but it may ultimately result in a method for collective bargaining being imposed on the employer. The CAC is the quasi-judicial body which, under Schedule A1, has power to order an employer to recognise a union and engage in collective bargaining if certain conditions are met. One of those conditions is that the people the union seeks to represent are “workers” within the meaning of section 296 of the 1992 Act. Having analysed the nature of the relationship between the riders and Deliveroo, the CAC accepted Deliveroo’s argument that the riders in question were not workers within that definition. It rejected an additional argument made by the IWGB that refusing to recognise the Union would breach the riders’ rights under article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the ECHR”), which protects freedom of peaceful assembly and association. The IWGB sought permission to challenge the CAC’s decision by judicial review. The High Court granted permission for the IWGB to bring its claim on one ground only: that the CAC’s decision breached the riders’ human rights under article 11 ECHR. The IWGB’s other grounds were held to be unarguable. Accordingly, the IWGB’s challenge proceeded on the basis that the riders do not fall within the domestic definition of “worker” under the 1992 Act, but this definition should be read down to include the riders in order to comply with their article 11 rights, as required under section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998. The High Court rejected that argument and dismissed the IWGB’s claim. The IWGB appealed to the Court of Appeal, who upheld the High Court’s judgment. The IWGB appealed again to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the IWGB’s appeal. It holds that the riders were not in an employment relationship for the purposes of article 11 ECHR, and the provisions of that article which protect trade union activity do not apply to them. The CAC’s decision to reject the IWGB’s application stands. Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lady Rose give a joint judgment, with which the other members of the Court agree.	Article 11 ECHR protects the general rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association with others, and a specific right to form and join trade unions which applies in more limited circumstances [37]. The case law of the European Court of Human Rights is clear that the right to form a trade union only arises in the context of an employment relationship. The concept of an employment relationship for the purposes of article 11 is freestanding and does not depend on the definitions of workers or employees used in domestic law [61]. The European Court has held that to decide whether there is an employment relationship for the purposes of article 11, a court should have regard to the factors set out in the International Labour Organisation Employment Relationship Recommendation, 2006 No 198. That recommendation makes the point that the assessment of such a relationship should be guided primarily by the facts relating to the performance of work and the remuneration of the worker, notwithstanding how the relationship is characterised in any contract or other agreement between the parties. The correct approach requires the Court to consider many different factors, focussing on the practicalities of the relationship and how it operates in reality [61]. Applying this approach to the facts of the case, the riders do not have an employment relationship with Deliveroo for the purposes of article 11 [71]. The CAC had rigorously scrutinised the substance of the relationship between Deliveroo and the riders. It examined in detail how the new contract between Deliveroo and the riders operated in practice and gave close scrutiny as to whether the provisions in that contract genuinely reflected the true relationship between the parties [70]. Some findings of the CAC were particularly significant. First, the contract between the riders and Deliveroo gives riders a broad and virtually unfettered right to appoint a substitute to take on their jobs. This right, on its face, is totally inconsistent with there being an employment relationship [69]. The CAC found that Deliveroo did not police a rider’s decision to use a substitute and riders would not be criticised or sanctioned for doing so. Secondly, the CAC found that Deliveroo did not terminate riders’ contracts for failing to accept a certain percentage of orders or failing to make themselves sufficiently available. The riders were free to work or not as convenient to them. Finally, the CAC found that Deliveroo did not object to riders working simultaneously for Deliveroo’s competitors. In all the circumstances, the CAC was entitled to conclude that the provisions in the contract genuinely reflected the reality of the relationship and that that was not an employment relationship [70]. As the riders do not have an employment relationship, they are not able to rely on the trade union rights conferred by article 11. However, as there is some lack of clarity in the case law, the Court also addresses the scope of the collective bargaining rights that article 11 confers for those workers who do have an employment relationship. The European Court of Human Rights has reiterated that states have a wide margin of discretion in how they choose to protect trade-union freedom [129], and it has not held that article 11 goes so far as to include a right to compulsory collective bargaining [134]. While states can go further than the Convention requires, as the UK has done by enacting Schedule A1, it would not be a breach of article 11 for a state to decline to legislate for compulsory collective bargaining [130].			
2023	uksc-2021-0159	Unger and another (in substitution for Hasan) (Appellants) v Ul-Hasan (deceased) and another (Respondents)	Nafisa Hasan ("the wife") and Mahmud Ul-Hasan ("the husband") married in 1981. In 2012 in Pakistan the husband obtained a divorce. The wife applied to the courts in England and Wales for financial relief under section 12(1) of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 ("the 1984 Act") on the basis that the divorce was an overseas divorce recognised as valid in England and Wales. On her application under the 1984 Act, the court in England and Wales was empowered to make any of the orders which it could make under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 ("the 1973 Act") if a decree of divorce had been granted in England and Wales.  The husband died before the final determination of the wife's application. Nonetheless, the wife wished to pursue her claim for financial relief against the husband's estate. In the High Court, Mostyn J considered that he was bound by the prior decision of the Court of Appeal in Sugden v Sugden [1957] P 120, but would otherwise have held that the wife could continue her claim against the estate of the deceased husband on the basis that the wife's unadjudicated claim for financial relief was a cause of action vested in her and subsisting against the husband's estate under section 1(1) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 ("the 1934 Act"). He considered that the Court of Appeal authority was incorrect but was binding on him so that he was compelled to and did dismiss the wife's claim against the estate of the husband.  Mostyn J granted a "leapfrog" certificate enabling an application to be made for leave to appeal directly from the High Court to the Supreme Court and this court granted that application.  Before this appeal was heard, the wife died. The appellants before this court are the personal representatives of the wife's estate and the second respondent is the executor of the husband's estate.  There were two issues before the Supreme Court.  The first was whether the rights under the 1984 Act read with the 1973 Act, were personal rights which could only be adjudicated between living parties so that, on the death of the husband, the wife could not pursue her claim for financial relief against the husband's estate.  The second was whether a claim for financial relief under the 1984 Act is a cause of action which survives against the estate of a deceased spouse under section 1(1) of the 1934 Act.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal.  Lord Stephens gives the lead judgment, with which Lord Hodge, Lord Hamblen and Lord Burrows agree. Lord Stephens concluded that the true construction of the 1984 Act read with the 1973 Act is that, when a party to an application under Part III of the 1984 Act dies, further proceedings cannot be taken [102]. To allow proceedings to continue after the death of a party to the marriage would require a major reform to the law, which is for Parliament [101].  Lord Leggatt gives a concurring judgment, with which Lord Hodge, Lord Hamblen and Lord Burrows agree. Lord Leggatt added observations about the defect in the law which Mostyn J's judgment had exposed [104].	The Court noted the principles surrounding matrimonial property and family relationships have changed [7]. It is no longer correct to question whether the rights created by matrimonial legislation are rightly called rights [8].  Applying the principles in Barder v Caluori [1988] AC 20 [23 – 26] to this appeal, the question is whether, where one of the parties to an application under the 1984 Act for financial relief has died, further proceedings can be taken. In answering this question, one must first identify the nature of the further proceedings – here, a continuation of the claim for financial relief. Second, one must determine whether on the true construction of the relevant statutory provisions the right to apply for financial relief can only be adjudicated between living parties [30 – 32].  If the relevant statutory provisions create personal rights and obligations between living parties only, there is no need to go on to consider whether the claim for financial relief is a cause of action within s1(1) of the 1934 Act [33].  To arrive at the true construction of the statutory provisions enabling the wife to apply for financial relief, it is appropriate to consider the legal context and judicial decisions prior to the enactment of the 1984 and 1973 Acts [38].  It is clear from judicial decisions that matrimonial legislation was understood as creating personal rights and obligations which end on the death of a party to the marriage [39 – 64].  The orthodox understanding that financial provision on divorce only enables orders to be made as between living parties to a former marriage is also supported by the provisions which Parliament enacted in the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 (the "1975 Act"). The Law Commission reports which lead to the 1975 Act support this conclusion [65 – 74]. This statutory construction also avoids the duplication which would otherwise occur by creating two different routes to secure financial relief following the death of a spouse [75]. Further, a textual analysis of the 1984 and 1973 Acts supports this view [78 – 94]. Barder v Caluori created a limited exception to the general rule [95 – 100].  As on their true construction the statutory provisions in the 1984 and 1973 Acts create personal rights and obligations which can only be adjudicated between living parties, the first issue is determined in favour of the respondents and the appeal is dismissed.  The second issue as to whether a claim for financial relief under the 1984 Act is a cause of action which survives against the estate of a deceased spouse under s1(1) of the 1934 Act does not arise for determination [103]. However, if on their true construction, the statutory provisions in the 1984 and 1973 Acts had created rights and obligations which did not end on the death of the husband, then a claim for financial relief would be a cause of action within the meaning of the 1934 Act [35] [40].			
2023	uksc-2021-0188	Rakusen (Respondent) v Jepsen and others (Appellants)	This appeal is about Rent Repayment Orders. These are orders that can be made against landlords that have committed certain housing-related offences. They require a landlord to repay an amount of rent paid by a tenant (or pay to a local housing authority an amount of universal credit paid in respect of rent). The question which arises is whether they can only be made against a tenant's immediate landlord, or whether they can be made against a landlord higher up in a chain of tenancies (e.g. the landlord of the tenant's immediate landlord) – referred to as a "superior landlord".  The Respondent, Mr Rakusen, is the leaseholder of a flat in London. In May 2016 he granted a short residential tenancy of the flat to a company called Kensington Property Investment Group Ltd ("KPIG"). KPIG subsequently entered into separate agreements with each of the three Appellants by which they were each granted a right to occupy one room in the flat in exchange for a fee. As a result of this arrangement the flat was required to be licenced as a "house in multiple occupation" or "HMO" under the Housing Act 2004. However, no such licence was ever obtained.  In 2019 the Appellants applied for Rent Repayment Orders against Mr Rakusen on the basis that he was said to have committed an offence of being in control or management of an unlicenced HMO contrary to section 72 of the Housing Act 2004. Mr Rakusen denies that he committed such offence. He also applied to strike out the Appellants claims arguing that a Rent Repayment Order could only be made in favour of the Appellants against their immediate landlord (i.e. KPIG).  The First-tier Tribunal refused to strike out the Appellants claims against Mr Rakusen and the Upper Tribunal dismissed Mr Rakusen’s appeal. They held that it was possible to make a Rent Repayment Order against a superior landlord. However, the Court of Appeal reversed this decision. The Appellants now appeal to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. It holds that a Rent Repayment Order cannot be made against a superior landlord. Lord Briggs and Lord Burrows give a joint judgment with which the other members of the panel agree.	The central statutory provision in question is section 40(2) of the Housing and Planning Act 2016. A straightforward interpretation of the words in section 40(2) is that a Rent Repayment Order cannot be made against a superior landlord and can only be made against the immediate landlord of the tenancy that generates the relevant rent [30].  This is because Rent Repayment Orders can be made against "the landlord under a tenancy of housing in England" (section 40(2)), who can be required to "repay an amount of rent paid by a tenant" (section 40(2)(a)). The "rent paid by a tenant" plainly refers to the rent paid under the "tenancy of housing" referred to previously. It would therefore be unnatural to interpret "landlord under a tenancy" as referring to any landlord other than the landlord of the tenancy which generates the rent of which repayment is sought [24]-[28].  The words "repay … rent paid by a tenant" also support this interpretation. They naturally refer to a landlord repaying rent that it has received directly from the tenant. It would strain the language to say that a superior landlord is "repaying" rent to a tenant from whom it had never received any rent [31].  The Court considers that, on balance, wider contextual factors and an examination of the purpose of the provision support or, at least, are consistent with this straightforward interpretation [59].  First, when Rent Repayment Orders were originally introduced by the Housing Act 2004 they could only be made against the immediate landlord. There is no indication, including in pre-legislative material, that a purpose was to change this when the legislative scheme was revised in 2016 [36];[55].  Second, although some of the offences which form the basis of a Rent Repayment Order can be committed by superior landlords, some can also be committed by people who are not landlords at all (eg property agents). There is no suggestion that Rent Repayment Orders could be made against these other non-landlord offenders. It seems that the purpose was to restrict Rent Repayment Orders to those who directly benefit from the payment of rent – ie immediate landlords [38].  Third, there is a range of other sanctions available to combat rogue landlords. These include fines, civil penalties and banning orders. Ultimately it is a matter for Parliament to decide whether these are sufficient [40]-[43].  Fourth, allowing a Rent Repayment Order to be made against a superior landlord could create complexity as to how much was payable by whom and to whom where there is a chain involving numerous tenancies [44]-[46].  Fifth, the straightforward interpretation is supported by reading section 40(2)(a) together with section 44(3) of the 2016 Act [49]. Support is also found in the fact that certain offences under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 expressly extended the definition of landlord to include "any superior landlord", but this was not done in the provisions relating to Rent Repayment Orders [50].  Sixth, taken as a whole, the pre-legislative materials are consistent with the straightforward interpretation that Rent Repayment Orders are not available against a superior landlord [51]-[56].  Finally, the straightforward interpretation is supported by the principle that where there is any doubt as to whether a statutory provision imposes a penalty on someone it should be resolved in favour of not imposing the penalty [57]-[58].  The conclusion reached by the Court is that the additional relevant interpretative factors on balance support or, at least, are consistent with the straightforward interpretation of the words of section 40(2) [59].  A Rent Repayment Order cannot therefore be made against a superior landlord [60].			
2023	uksc-2021-0189	Target Group Ltd (Appellant) v Commissioners for His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (Respondent)	Value added tax (“VAT”) is paid on all services supplied for consideration by a taxable person and its application is governed by the Council Directive 2006/112/EC (the “Principal VAT Directive”). The Principal VAT Directive exempts specified supplies from VAT under article 135(1)(d). This ‘financial services exemption’ applies to “transactions…concerning payments, transfers, debts, but excluding debt collection.” Shawbrook Bank Limited (‘Shawbrook’) is a provider of mortgages and loans. The appellant (“Target”) administers loans made by Shawbrook, including by operating individual loan accounts and instigating and processing payments due from borrowers. This appeal concerns whether the outsourced loan administration services provided by Target to customers on behalf of Shawbrook fall within the financial services 135(1)(d) exemption. The First Tier Tribunal (“FTT”) found that Target’s supply included transactions concerning payments or transfers within the financial services exemption but that the predominant nature of the supply was debt collection, therefore excluded from the exemption and taxable. The Upper Tribunal (“UT”) held that the services supplied by Target to Shawbrook were not exempt but were standard rated supplies for VAT purposes. The UT further held that Target’s inputting of accounting entries in the loan account did not fall within the exemption as it did not change any party’s legal and financial position. Target appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal, unanimously, dismissed the appeal. Target now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal, unanimously holding that the financial services exemption did not apply to Target’s loan administration services. Lord Hamblen gives the judgment, with which all the other Justices agree.	Target contends that its services fall under the financial services exemption for two reasons: (1) by giving instructions which automatically and inevitably resulted in payment from the borrower’s bank accounts to Shawbrook’s bank accounts via the Bankers’ Automated Clearing System (“BACS”) (the “payments/transfers issue”); and/or (2) by the inputting of entries into the borrower’s loan accounts with Shawbrook (the “loan accounts issue”). The payments/transfers issue The proper interpretation of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) case law is critical to the resolution of the payments/transfers issue [20]. In Sparekassernes Datacenter (‘SDC’) v Skatteministeriet (Case C-2/95) [1997] ECR I-3017, [1997] STC 932, (“SDC”) it was held that “viewed broadly” and as “a distinct whole, to be exempt, the services must: (i) have the effect of transferring funds and, (ii) change the legal and financial situation of the relevant parties [53, SDC] [28].This left open the question of whether the services must in themselves have that effect and make that change (“the narrow interpretation”) or whether it was sufficient for them to have that causal effect (‘the wider interpretation’) [28]. In the Court of Appeal decision of Customs and Excise Commissioners v FDR Limited [2000] EWCA Civ 216, [2000] STC 672 (“FDR”) it was held that the wider interpretation is appropriate. Target contended that later CJEU case law had re-affirmed the correctness of that interpretation. The judgment considers the CJEU case law since SDC in detail and concludes that it makes it clear that the narrow interpretation is the correct one. This is established in particular by the cases of Bookit Ltd v Revenue and Customs Comrs (Case C-607/14) EU:C:2016:355 (26 May 2016) (“Bookit II”); National Exhibition Centre Ltd v Revenue and Customs Comrs (Case C-130/15) [2016] STC 2132 (26 May 2016) (“NEC”), and HMRC v DPAS Ltd (Case C-5/17) [2018] STC 1615 (25 July 2018) (“DPAS”) [55]. The narrow interpretation accords with the rationale of the exemption to apply to situations where there are difficulties determining the consideration of financial services and therefore the tax base for VAT liability [19]. It seeks to exempt services that themselves effect the transfer of funds and change the legal and financial situations of the relevant parties. The exemption must also be interpreted strictly [55]. It follows that the giving of instructions is not enough even if that inevitably results in a payment or transfer [65]. It is necessary to be involved in the carrying out or execution of the transfer or payment – its “materialisation”. This requires functional participation and performance [55]. Given this conclusion, it is apparent that domestic law took a wrong turn in FDR and the Court of Appeal’s conclusion, as set out in paragraph 42 of its judgment in FDR, must be overruled [64]. The loan accounts issue Target submits that the making of accounting entries is the standard modern means of effecting movements of value and that unilateral accounting entries may be sufficient to effect a transfer of payment [68]. Target characterises its role as debiting and crediting the borrower loan accounts with Shawbrook and thereby making changes to the financial and legal situation of the parties so as to fall within the exemption [68]. This position however is undermined by the FTT’s factual findings that the entries in the ledgers were of “expected payments” which were “assumed to be made” [73]. On any view such an entry cannot effect a payment or transfer or result in a change of the legal position of the parties [74]. The loan account was no more than a ledger, recording the effect of payments made by customers to Shawbrook but not effecting such payments. Conclusion For these reasons, the Court rejects Target’s two grounds for contending that its services fall within the financial services exemption. It is therefore unnecessary for the Court to consider any further issues which arise.			
2023	uksc-2021-0195	R (on the application of Marouf) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent)	The public sector equality duty ("PSED") imposed by section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 is a procedural obligation that requires public bodies to have due regard to the equality needs listed in that section when exercising their functions. This appeal concerns the territorial scope of the PSED. It raises the issue of whether a public body is required under the PSED to have due regard to people living outside the United Kingdom when exercising its functions.  The Appellant is a Palestinian refugee currently living in Lebanon, having fled the conflict in Syria. She asserts that she should be treated as eligible to come to the United Kingdom under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme ("the Resettlement Scheme") instituted by the Government in 2014. However, the Resettlement Scheme applied only to refugees referred by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ("UNHCR"). The Appellant is outside the remit of the UNHCR because she is registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ("UNRWA"). Whereas UNHCR has a specific mandate to assist refugees by local integration in the country where they are living, or by resettlement in a third country, UNRWA has no such mandate. It follows that in practice, Palestinian refugees cannot take part in the Resettlement Scheme.  The Appellant brought judicial review proceedings challenging the lawfulness of the Secretary of State's adoption and operation of the Resettlement Scheme. The ground of challenge directly relevant to this appeal was that the Secretary of State had failed to comply with the PSED because she did not have due regard to the equality needs set out in that section.  The High Court held that the PSED did have extraterritorial effect. On appeal, the Court of Appeal disagreed and held that it did not. The Appellant now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lady Rose gives the judgment, with which Lord Reed, Lord Hodge, Lord Burrows and Lord Richards agree.	The presumption against the extraterritorial effect of legislation  The starting point for consideration of the scope of the enactment is the presumption in domestic law that legislation is not intended to have extraterritorial effect [36]. This well-established principle has been applied for very many years to many enactments. In the absence of express words, the extraterritorial application of legislation may be implied but there is a high threshold to overcome before any such implication [41].  The extraterritorial effect of section 149 as a whole  The Appellant's primary case was that the whole of section 149 has extraterritorial effect [9]. She relies particularly on section 149(1)(b), arguing that the Secretary of State had failed to have due regard to the need to advance equality of opportunity for persons who share a relevant protected characteristic (in this case being a Palestinian refugee) as compared with persons who do not share it (in this case, other refugees) [3].  The Supreme Court holds that there is nothing in the legislation from which one can imply that the presumption against extraterritoriality has been overridden. On the contrary, the scope of the equality goals which public authorities should aspire to achieve suggests there is no such intention. The PSED is intended to ensure that specified public bodies have due regard to the need to adopt policies which help to bring about societal change that would see the elimination of discrimination and promotion of equality of opportunity and good relations between different groups within the community. There is no duty on public bodies under section 149 to attempt to bring about that kind of change in countries outside the United Kingdom. It is not open to a person with a protected characteristic but no connection to the United Kingdom to rely on the PSED to challenge a decision of a public body on the grounds that a policy adopted failed to have due regard to the need to improve their position within that overseas community [54], [56].  Extraterritorial effect of section 149(1)(a) co-extensive with a breach of section 29(6) of the Equality Act 2010  The Appellant's alternative case was that the specific procedural duty under section 149(1)(a) to have due regard to the need to avoid unlawful discrimination has extraterritorial effect. The Appellant relies on the Court of Appeal's decision that the substantive prohibition on unlawful discrimination, under section 29(6), has extraterritorial effect to a limited extent [9] (although the Court of Appeal held there had been no unlawful discrimination in this case). The substantive provision applies to individual Palestinian refugees at the point when they are prevented from proceeding to the next stage of being considered for resettlement under the Resettlement Scheme [61]. Thus, the Appellant argues that the territorial scope of the procedural duty must be as wide as the relevant substantive provisions that set out the duty not to discriminate [58].  The Supreme Court holds that the procedural duty to have due regard to the need to avoid unlawful discrimination under section 149(1)(a) is not engaged. The PSED is primarily directed at policy decisions not at the application of policy to individual cases [62]. The Appellant's argument would confer rights on people all over the world to challenge the decision-making process of a public body exercising its functions, if the exercise of the public body's functions affected them [64]. Given the very serious implications of that construction for public bodies, if Parliament wanted extraterritorial effect to apply to part of section 149(1) but not to the other parts, it would have made this express in the legislation [66].			
2023	uksc-2021-0201	Thaler (Appellant) v Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks (Respondent)	In October and November 2018, Dr Stephen Thaler, the Appellant, filed two applications (GB18116909.4 and GB1818161.0) (“the applications”) for the grant of patents for what were said to be inventions for new and useful devices and methods. The applications were filed by Dr Thaler under the Patents Act 1977 (“the 1977 Act”). The request for grant forms which accompanied them stated that Dr Thaler was not an inventor. Dr Thaler was notified that he would need to file a statement of inventorship and an indication of the derivation of his right to the grant of the patents within 16 months of the filing date of the applications in accordance with section 13(2) of the 1977 Act and rule 10(3) of the Patent Rules 2007 (“the Rules”). Dr Thaler responded and has maintained that the inventor was in each case a machine called DABUS, acting autonomously and powered by artificial intelligence (“AI”), and that he acquired the right to the grant of the patents by his ownership of that machine. Dr Thaler requested a hearing at which he argued that the information he had provided met the requirements of the 1977 Act and the Rules. On 4 December 2019, the Hearing Officer for the Comptroller, the Respondent, issued a decision that DABUS could not be regarded as an inventor for the purposes of the 1977 Act, and further, that Dr Thaler was not entitled to apply for the patents simply by his ownership of DABUS. The Comptroller also indicated that the applications would be taken to be withdrawn at the expiry of the sixteen-month period specified by rule 10(3) of the Rules. Dr Thaler’s appeal against the Comptroller’s decision and order was dismissed in the High Court and by a majority in the Court of Appeal. Dr Thaler now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal, holding that the Comptroller was right to find that the applications would be taken to be withdrawn at the expiry of the sixteen-month period specified in rule 10(3) of the Rules. Lord Kitchin gives the judgment, with which all the other Justices agree.	As a preliminary matter, this appeal is not concerned with the broader question whether technical advances generated by machines acting autonomously and powered by AI should be patentable. It is concerned instead with the interpretation and application of the relevant provisions of the 1977 Act [50]. Dr Thaler has made clear that he is not an inventor; that his case is that the inventions described in the applications were made by DABUS; and that his right to the grant of patents for those inventions arises from his ownership of DABUS. For the purposes of these proceedings, the Comptroller could not and did not go behind Dr Thaler’s assertions of fact. The outcome of the appeal therefore turns on three issues. Issue 1: the scope and meaning of the term “inventor” in the 1997 Act. The first issue concerns the scope and meaning of the term “inventor” in the 1977 Act and whether it extends to a machine such as DABUS. This turns on the interpretation of sections 7 and 13 of the Act. The Supreme Court holds that an inventor within the meaning of the 1977 Act must be a natural person [56-59]. Confirmation of the correctness of this interpretation is found in Rhone-Poulenc Rorer International Holdings Inc v Yeda Research and Development Co Ltd [2007] UKHL 43 [60-61]. There Lord Hoffmann explained, in the context of a dispute over entitlement, that the inventor is the natural person who came up with the inventive concept. Further, section 7(2) and section 7(3) provide an exhaustive code for deciding who is entitled to the grant of a patent [62]. The inventor must be a natural person and any other person to whom the patent may be granted must claim through the inventor [63]. Yet further confirmation that an inventor must be a natural person is to be found in the terms of section 13, which contain no suggestion that an inventor may be a machine [65]. In all the circumstances, the Comptroller was right to decide that DABUS is not and was not the inventor of any new product or process described in the applications. Further, it is not and never was an “inventor” for the purposes of section 7 or section 13 of the 1977 Act [73]. Issue 2: Was Dr Thaler nevertheless the owner of any invention in any technical advance made by DABUS and entitled to apply for and obtain a patent in respect of it? Dr Thaler contends that he was nevertheless entitled to file applications for and obtain the grant of patents for the inventions described and disclosed in each of the applications on the basis of his ownership of DABUS [76]. This contention must be rejected. First, section 7 of the 1977 Act confers the right to apply for and obtain a patent and it provides a complete code for that purpose. The section requires there to be an inventor and an inventor must be a person. DABUS is not a person [77]. Secondly, the applicant, if not the inventor, must be a person falling within one of the limbs of section 7(2)(b) or alternatively, within section 7(2)(c) [78]. Dr Thaler does not satisfy any part of this carefully structured code [79]. Dr Thaler submits that this analysis is incomplete because the 1977 Act recognises that there is property in an invention at the time it is made [80]. He also contends that as the owner of DABUS and by analogy with or upon application of the doctrine of accession, he derived the right to apply for and be granted patents for the inventions described in the applications [82]. These submissions cannot be accepted. First, they assume, wrongly, that DABUS can be and is an inventor [84]. Secondly, they mischaracterise an invention as being or amounting to tangible property such that title to it can pass, as a matter of law, to the owner of the machine which, on this assumption, generated it [85]. There is no basis for applying the doctrine of accession in these circumstances. The Court of Appeal was right to hold that the doctrine of accession does not, as a matter of law, operate to confer on Dr Thaler the property in or the right to apply for and obtain a patent for any technical development made by DABUS acting autonomously [89]. Issue 3: was the Hearing Officer entitled to hold that the applications would be taken to be withdrawn? In all these circumstances the Hearing Officer for the Comptroller was entitled to hold that Dr Thaler did not satisfy either of the requirements in section 13(2) of the 1977 Act: he failed to identify any person or persons whom he believed to be the inventor or inventors of the inventions described in the applications [93]; and his ownership of DABUS did not provide a proper basis for accepting his claim to be entitled to the grant of the patents for which he had applied [98]. The Comptroller was right to find the applications would be taken to be withdrawn at the expiry of the sixteen-month period specified by rule 10(3) of the Rules [99]. The judge and the Court of Appeal made no error in affirming that decision and in finding that the applications are now deemed to have been withdrawn.			
2023	uksc-2021-0208	TUI UK Ltd (Respondent) v Griffiths (Appellant)	This appeal concerns the question of when a trial judge can decide that a claimant has not proved their case where the evidence of a claimant’s expert witness on the central issue in the case has not been challenged by a defendant on cross-examination of that witness. Mr and Mrs Griffiths and their youngest son went on an all-inclusive package holiday to a hotel resort in Turkey. While staying at the hotel, Mr Griffiths suffered a serious stomach upset, which has left him with long term problems. Mr Griffiths sued the travel company, TUI Ltd, from whom he had purchased the holiday. At trial, Mr and Mrs Griffiths gave uncontested evidence as to the underlying facts. Mr Griffiths also presented evidence from an expert witness, Professor Pennington, who concluded that the likely cause of Mr Griffiths’ stomach upset was the food and drink served at the hotel. TUI did not cross-examine Professor Pennington, nor did it present any expert witness evidence of its own on the central question of causation. Instead, in its closing submissions, it argued that deficiencies in Professor Pennington’s report, such as incomplete explanations and a failure expressly to discount other possible causes, meant that Mr Griffiths had failed to prove his case. The trial judge agreed with TUI. She criticised Professor Pennington’s report and found that it did not show that it was more likely than not that the food and drink at the hotel had caused Mr Griffiths’ stomach upset. She therefore concluded that Mr Griffiths had not proved his case and dismissed his claim. Mr Griffiths appealed this judgment to the High Court of England and Wales, which allowed his appeal and overturned the judgment of the trial judge. TUI appealed that judgment and the Court of Appeal of England and Wales found in TUI’s favour. Mr Griffiths then appealed to the UK Supreme Court.	The Court unanimously allows Mr Griffith’s appeal. It holds that the trial judge was wrong to allow TUI to make the detailed criticisms of Professor Pennington’s report and to accept those submissions. In doing so, she denied Mr Griffiths a fair trial. The Court also holds that, looking at the evidence that Mr Griffiths presented at trial, including Professor Pennington’s evidence, he has shown that it was more likely than not that the food and drink at the hotel had caused his stomach upset.	The Court holds that the general rule in civil cases is that a party must challenge by cross-examination the evidence of any witness of the opposing party on a material point which he or she claims should not be accepted by the trial judge. This includes both witnesses of fact and expert witnesses [61] and [70(i)]. As the justice system is adversarial (i.e., premised on both sides presenting their cases to an impartial judge), this requirement is essential to ensure fairness to the parties, the impugned witness, and the court [70(ii)] – [70(iv)]. This requirement gives the witness an opportunity to explain or clarify his or her evidence or defend his or her professional reputation if challenged and allows the trial judge to make a proper assessment of all the evidence in the case [70(iv) – 70(vi)]. This requirement is not confined only to instances in which a party impugns the character of a witness [70(vi)]. It applies more broadly, encompassing cases such as this one. However, the Court explains that this requirement is not a rigid one. Its application depends upon the circumstances of each case. The question for a court is whether, taken as a whole, the trial is fair [70(vii)]. The Court gives seven (non-exclusive) instances in which this requirement may be relaxed [61] – [68] and [70(viii)]. First, the matter to which the challenge is directed is collateral or insignificant such that fairness to the witness does not require there to be an opportunity to answer or explain. Secondly, the evidence itself may be manifestly unbelievable and an opportunity to explain on cross-examination would make no difference. Thirdly, the expert report makes an assertion with no reasoning in support. Fourthly, where there is an obvious mistake on the face of the expert report. For example, the report may be clearly illogical or inherently inconsistent. Fifthly, a party’s fact evidence may be contrary to the factual basis on which the expert witness made their report. Sixthly, an expert witness has been given a sufficient opportunity to respond to criticism of, or otherwise clarify, their report other than on cross-examination. For example, if questions were put to the expert witness by an opposing party (such as under the Practice Direction to the Civil Procedure Rule 35 (“CPR PD 35”)) and the expert witness fails to answer them satisfactorily. There, the expert witness will have been given a sufficient opportunity to explain the report, negating the need for further challenge on cross-examination. Seventhly, the expert witness’ report does not comply with the requirements of CPR PD 35. In applying these principles to the case at hand, the Court holds that fairness required that Professor Pennington be given the opportunity to respond to TUI’s criticisms [71] – [78]. TUI chose not to challenge Professor Pennington’s report on cross examination, nor lodge its own expert report. The questions TUI asked under CPR PD 35 did not focus on the matters which it later criticised. While Professor Pennington’s report was terse and could have included more reasoning, it was not a bare assertion. He also provided further explanation of his reasoning in response to TUI’s CPR PD 35 questions. None of the exceptions identified at [61] – [68] apply. In accepting TUI’s criticisms of Professor Pennington’s report, the trial judge had denied Mr Griffiths a fair trial. The Court also holds, relying on the trial judge’s other findings of fact and the conclusions in Professor Pennington’s report, that Mr Griffith has established that it was more likely than not that the food and drink at the hotel had caused his stomach upset [78].			
2023	uksc-2021-0212-0213	Commissioners for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (Respondent) v Fisher and another (Appellants) Commissioners for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (Appellant) v Fisher (Respondent) No 2	This appeal concerns the transfer of assets abroad (“TOAA”) code set out in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (“ICTA 1988”). Specifically, it concerns the application of section 739 of ICTA 1988, which specifies the circumstances in which an individual who transfers assets to a person overseas may be liable to pay tax on income arising from those assets after the date of transfer. Anne and Stephen Fisher are the parents of Peter and Dianne Fisher (together, the “Fishers”). The Fishers established a betting business which, from 1988, was run through a UK company, Stan James (Abingdon) Limited (“SJA”). The Fishers held the shares in SJA and acted as directors of the company. SJA specialised in “telebetting”, which involves the placing of bets by telephone. The Fishers decided to transfer their betting operations to Gibraltar, which at the time charged a significantly lower rate of betting duty. They initially set up a branch of SJA in Gibraltar and later incorporated a new company in Gibraltar, Stan James Gibraltar Limited (“SJG”). In 2000 SJA and SJG entered into an agreement transferring the whole of SJA’s business (other than its betting shops in the UK) to SJG. The agreement was signed by Stephen Fisher as director on behalf of SJA and Peter Fisher as director on behalf of SJG. At the time of the transfer, the shareholdings in each of SJA and SJG were held entirely by the Fishers in varying proportions. HMRC issued assessments to tax to each of Stephen, Anne and Peter in respect of a number of years of assessment falling between 2000/2001 and 2007/2008. Pursuant to section 739 of ICTA 1988, HMRC treated the profits of SJG as the deemed income of the Fishers in proportion to their respective shareholdings in the company. HMRC did not seek to tax Dianne as she was not a UK resident. The Fishers (excluding Dianne) appealed to the First-tier Tribunal Tax Chamber (“the FTT”). The FTT agreed with HMRC that for the purposes of section 739 the Fishers should be treated as the transferors of the business sold by SJA to SJG. The FTT allowed Anne’s appeal on other grounds and allowed the appeals of Peter and Stephen in respect of some of the years of assessment on other grounds not relevant to the present appeal. The Upper Tribunal (Tax Chamber) allowed the Fishers’ appeal on the ground that the transfer of assets had been made by SJA and not the Fishers. The Court of Appeal by a majority allowed HMRC’s appeal as regards Stephen and Peter but dismissed it as regards Anne. The Fishers and HMRC now appeal to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the Fishers’ appeal and dismisses HMRC’s appeal. It holds that the Fishers were not either singly or collectively the transferors of the business that was sold by SJA to SJG. Lady Rose gives the judgment, with which all the other Justices agree.	The statutory provisions It was common ground that the appeal should be determined on the basis of the legislation as it stood between March 1997 and April 2007 [7]. In broad terms, section 739 is an anti-tax avoidance provision that applies where an individual resident in the UK transfers assets abroad with the result that income arising from those assets becomes payable to a person abroad [2], [8]-[19]. Where the individual resident in the UK retains the “power to enjoy” the income (for example, the individual is able to control how the income is spent), as defined in the Act, the provision operates so that the income received by the overseas person is treated as income of the individual resident in the UK. That UK resident individual is then taxed on the income. It is not a requirement of the provision that the individual resident in the UK actually receives any of the income within the jurisdiction. Section 740 of ICTA 1988 imposes liability on an individual resident in the UK who has received a benefit because of the transfer of assets outside of the UK but who did not themselves carry out the transfer [14]. Does the individual charged to tax under section 739 have to be the transferor of the assets? The Fishers argue that in order to fall within section 739(2), the taxpayer has to be the individual who transferred the assets [29]. They rely on the House of Lords decision in Vestey v Inland Revenue Commissioners (Nos 1 and 2) [1980] AC 1148 (“Vestey”), which concerned an earlier version of the provision. HMRC argue that the interpretation upheld in Vestey should not be followed in the present case as ICTA 1988 differs in important respects from the predecessor legislation. The Supreme Court holds that section 739 is limited to charging individuals who transfer assets abroad [55]. That is the most natural interpretation of the legislation [56]. The changes made to the legislation since Vestey do not undermine the reasoning in that case. The severe effect of section 739 for a taxpayer means that it is inappropriate to apply it to someone who was not the transferor [57]. The presence of the section 742(9), which extends the reference to “an individual” in section 739 to include the spouse of the individual, is inconsistent with HMRC’s proposed interpretation [60]. There would be no need for the spousal extension if everyone who has the power to enjoy the income could be charged regardless of whether they are a transferor or not. Similarly, the inclusion of section 740, which deals with the liability of non-transferors, weighs against a wider interpretation of section 739 [59]. Did the Fishers transfer the assets? HMRC argue that, notwithstanding that the legal transferor of the assets was SJA and not the Fishers, the Fishers should be treated as the transferors of the assets because together they owned the controlling interest in SJA [63]. The Supreme Court holds that section 739 does not apply to an individual in relation to a transfer made by a company in which they are a shareholder, regardless of the size of their shareholding [73], [76]. There are no principled criteria set out in the statute which can be used to determine the circumstances in which a shareholder should be treated as responsible for a transfer made by a company [74]-[76]. In contrast with other statutory regimes, the TOAA code does not provide any framework for determining when an individual should be treated as controlling a company for this purpose [77]-[79]. The existence of multiple transferors for the purposes of section 739 would cause numerous difficulties in the provision’s application [79]-[85].			
2023	uksc-2021-0216	Moulsdale t/a Moulsdale Properties (Appellant) v Commissioners for His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (Respondent) (Scotland)	The question that this appeal raises is whether Mr Moulsdale (trading as Moulsdale Properties) should have charged value added tax ("VAT") on the sale price of a property which he sold to a purchaser who had no connection to him in September 2014.  Sales of land and buildings are generally exempt from VAT in accordance with Schedule 9 Group 1 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 ("VATA"). However, paragraph 1 of Schedule 10 to VATA gives a taxable person an option to tax transactions relating to a particular parcel of land. Where the option to tax is exercised, VAT must be charged and accounted for to His Majesty's Revenue and Customs ("HMRC") whenever there is a sale of that land. Paragraphs 12 to 17 of Schedule 10 to VATA provide for compulsory disapplication of an option to tax in certain circumstances. If the option to tax is disapplied in accordance with those paragraphs, a sale of property where an option to tax has been exercised goes back to being a sale that is VAT exempt.  In 2001, Mr Moulsdale bought a building for a purchase price to which VAT was added because the seller had opted to tax the land on which the building was built. Mr Moulsdale then himself exercised an option to tax that land. This enabled him to claim back from HMRC the input VAT he had paid to the seller. In 2014, Mr Moulsdale sold the property to a company which was not registered for VAT. When Mr Moulsdale sold the property, he did not add VAT to the purchase price. Mr Moulsdale argues he did not charge VAT because Schedule 10 to VATA meant his option to tax was disapplied and so the sale of the property was VAT exempt. HMRC disagreed. HMRC's position is that the sale was not tax exempt, and Mr Moulsdale should have charged the purchaser VAT and then paid that VAT over to HMRC.  Mr Moulsdale was unsuccessful in challenging HMRC's decision before the First-Tier Tribunal, Upper Tribunal, and the Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland. Mr Moulsdale now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lady Rose gives the judgment, with which Lord Reed, Lord Briggs, Lord Sales and Lord Hamblen agree.	The statutory provisions  The legislation which determines whether VAT is chargeable on the sale of land is Schedule 10 to VATA. The case turns on whether Mr Moulsdale is a "developer" of the land as defined in paragraphs 12 – 17 of that Schedule. Unfortunately, because of the way the provisions are drafted there is a conundrum in the legislation when it comes to deciding whether Mr Moulsdale is a developer of the land and hence whether the sale of the land is subject to VAT or is exempt from VAT. Under Schedule 10:  If Mr Moulsdale did intend or expect the purchaser to pay VAT on the sale price for the building (that price being more than the minimum set of £250,000) then Mr Moulsdale is a developer of the land. That would mean that paragraph 12(1) of Schedule 10 disapplies the option to tax, so that the sale of the land reverts to being an exempt transaction on which Mr Moulsdale should not charge VAT. However, if Mr Moulsdale did not intend or expect that the purchaser would pay VAT on the price of the building (being more than the minimum of £250,000), then Mr Moulsdale would not fall within the definition of a "developer of the land" and the option to tax would still apply, making the sale subject to VAT. The effect of the relevant Schedule 10 provisions is therefore that if Mr Moulsdale charges VAT then he is a developer of the land and VAT is not payable because the option to tax is disapplied but if Mr Moulsdale does not charge VAT then he is not a developer of the land and the option to tax still applies to the sale so that he should charge VAT [4], [33-34].  The proper construction of paragraphs 12 and 13 of Schedule 10  Mr Moulsdale and HMRC acknowledge the circularity problem created by the provisions of Schedule 10 and have proposed different solutions [38].  Mr Moulsdale argues for a broad construction of the provisions. He contends that because he has exercised the option to tax in relation to the land, he did intend or expect that the purchaser would pay VAT on the purchase price of the land. On Mr Moulsdale's solution, the VAT inquiry should stop here. Accordingly, because Mr Moulsdale has the relevant expectation, he is a developer of the land, and the sale is therefore exempt, and he was correct not to charge VAT. Mr Moulsdale argues that to avoid the circularity, one should not go on to reconsider the disapplication of the option to tax after concluding that the sale is exempt [39].  However, the Supreme Court holds that the narrow construction put forward by HMRC is the correct construction as it makes as much sense as one can of the legislation. The Supreme Court agrees with HMRC’s solution that for the purposes of these provisions, in order to decide whether the sale should bear VAT or not, the relevant intention or expectation as to whether the purchaser would pay VAT on a capital expense in relation to the building must be an intention or expectation about incurring VAT on some other cost, different from the actual price of the building itself [56], [67]. Thus, HMRC was correct that Mr Moulsdale should have charged VAT on the sale price.  The Supreme Court holds that Schedule 10 is aimed at ensuring that exempt businesses cannot recover input tax [58]. This purpose would be defeated on the construction Mr Moulsdale argues for. On his broad construction, the provisions would enable him to have the benefit of the option to tax the land as long as that was favourable to him but enable him to switch off the option to tax simply by selling it if he did not want to have to charge the purchaser VAT on the purchase price [60].			
2023	uksc-2021-0233	R (on the application of Palmer) (Appellant) v Northern Derbyshire Magistrates Court and another (Respondents)	The issue in this appeal is whether an administrator of a company appointed under the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “IA 1986”) is an “officer” of the company within the meaning of the phrase “any director, manager, secretary or similar officers of the body corporate”, as used in section 194 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (“TULRCA”). Sections 193(1) and (2) of TULRCA provide that, where an employer proposes to dismiss at least 20 employees as redundant within 90 days, it is required to give notice to the Secretary of State at least 30 days before those dismissals take effect. An employer who fails to give notice as required commits an offence under section 194(1) and, where the offence is proved to have been committed by a body corporate with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to neglect on the part of, "any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate", that person commits an offence under section 194(3). The appellant, Mr Palmer, was appointed as one of three joint administrators of West Coast Capital (USC) Ltd (“USC”) on 13 January 2015. On 14 January 2015, certain employees of USC were handed a letter, signed by Mr Palmer, stating that they were at risk of redundancy and giving notice of USC’s intention to consult with them at a staff meeting that day. Later the same day, they were handed a further letter, also signed by Mr Palmer, dismissing them with effect from that day. No notice of the redundancies was given to the Secretary of State until the relevant form, signed by Mr Palmer, was emailed on 4 February 2015. In July 2015, criminal proceedings were commenced against Mr Palmer, alleging that he had committed the offence set out in section 194 of TULRCA. Mr Palmer argued that he had not committed an offence because an administrator appointed under Part II of the IA 1986 is not an “officer” within section 194(3) of TULRCA. The Northern Derbyshire Magistrates Court held that Mr Palmer was such an “officer”. The Divisional Court dismissed his claim for judicial review. Mr Palmer now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Richards gives the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.	In the absence of any definition of “officer” for the purposes of section 193(3) of TULRCA, nor any clear statement of authority which can be taken as a definition of what is generally understood to be an officer, the first recourse must be to the IA 1986, as the statute which created and governs the process of administration and the position of an administrator, to determine whether it was intended that an administrator of a company should be an officer of that company [20]. None of the many references to “officer” within the IA 1986 suggests that an administrator is an officer of a company; importantly, some of the references clearly show that an administrator is not considered to be an officer of a company [21]-[26]. The relevant provisions of the IA 1986 provide a clear picture that it was not the intention or effect of the legislation, in creating the process of administration, to classify an administrator as an officer of the company in administration [27]. After considering the caselaw relied upon by the Divisional Court [29]-[39], the Court concluded that an administrator is not an officer of a company [40]. There was also no scope for an extended reading of “other similar officer” within section 194(3) to include an administrator. There is no hint in the language of the section that an expansive interpretation should be given to it. On the contrary, the restriction to an officer who can be said to be “similar” to a director, manager or secretary is inconsistent with an expansive interpretation [43]. The Court then considered the policy arguments advanced by the parties. Mr Palmer submitted that the inclusion of administrators within section 194(3) would confront administrators with a dilemma of either acting swiftly in the interests of achieving the statutory purposes of administration or complying with the notice requirements under sections 193 and 194 [45]. The Court held that administrators could not be excluded on this basis, given that companies in administration were not excluded from sections 193 and 194 [46]. The respondents advanced a different policy argument, submitting that if section 194(3) did not include administrators, a vacuum in responsibility would be left, with no mechanism to deter non-compliance and rendering the criminal sanction meaningless [47]. With this in mind, the Divisional Court adopted a functional test for determining the persons who came within the category of “other similar officers” [48]. This approach was not justified either by the language of the provision or by its context [50]. First, if the legislative intention had been to adopt a functional test, there was no difficulty in expressly doing so [51]. Second, section 194(4) expressly widens the scope of section 193(3) to include, in addition to officers of the body corporate, members of a body corporate where “the affairs of the body corporate are managed by its members”. That did not support a functional test; if Parliament intended such a test, these general words would have been used in section 194(3), and section 194(4) would have been unnecessary [53]. Third, long before the enactment of section 194 and its predecessors, it had been established that a receiver and manager was not an officer of the company. If Parliament had intended a functional test, section 194 would have been drafted in a way which gave effect to it [54]. The Court held that whether a person is an “officer” of a body corporate in the context of provisions such as section 194 is to be determined by asking whether that person holds an office within the constitutional structure of the body corporate. That is the normal meaning of an officer of a company or other institution, and the normal meaning is emphasised by the prior reference to directors, managers and secretaries in section 194(3), all of whom are officers in the conventional sense, together with the words “other similar” before “officers” [55]. An administrator of a company appointed under the IA 1986 is not therefore an “officer” of the company within the meaning of section 194(4) TULRCA. The appeal is allowed and the decision of the District Judge is quashed [56].			
2023	uksc-2022-0004	Smith and another (Appellant) v Royal Bank of Scotland (Respondent)	The question on these appeals is whether claims seeking orders under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to remedy unfairness in a credit relationship were brought in time. The two claimants, Ms Karen Smith and Mr Derek Burrell, each had a credit card issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland plc (“RBS”) and were sold Payment Protection Insurance (“PPI”) by RBS. This insurance covered credit card repayments in the event of death, accident, sickness or involuntary unemployment. RBS did not disclose to Ms Smith or Mr Burrell that most of the money paid by them for PPI did not go to the insurer but was retained by RBS as commission. Even to this day RBS has not revealed the exact size of its commission but it is now known that its commission was well over 50% of the payments made. RBS only informed Ms Smith and Mr Burrell that it had received commission when it offered them redress (in 2018 and 2017, respectively) under a scheme for PPI mis-selling established by the Financial Conduct Authority. The redress payments were said to represent commission received by RBS in excess of 50% of the amounts they had paid for PPI. By that time Ms Smith had already ended her PPI agreement (in 2006) and her credit card agreement with RBS (in 2015). Mr Burrell had also ended his PPI agreement (in 2008), but his credit agreement continued (until terminated in 2019). In August 2019, Ms Smith and Mr Burrell each brought a claim in the county court, seeking an order under section 140B of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 that RBS repay all the money paid by them for PPI (less the redress already paid), plus interest. Ms Smith’s claim succeeded before the district judge; and in Mr Burrell’s case the district judge made a ruling that the claim had been brought in time. Those decisions were both upheld on appeal by the county court judge. On second appeals, however, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of RBS, holding that in each case the relevant time limit for bringing a claim had expired before the claim was brought. Ms Smith and Mr Burrell now appeal to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeals, holding that both claims were brought before the relevant time limit expired. The orders made in the county court in each case are, therefore, restored. Lord Leggatt, with whom the other Justices agree, gives the leading judgment. Lord Hodge gives a concurring judgment.	Sections 140A–C of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 were added by the Consumer Credit Act 2006. They introduced a new regime intended to be less technical than the previous regime and to provide consumers with greater protection [12]. They require the court first to decide whether the relationship between the creditor and the debtor arising out of the credit agreement between them (either alone or taken with any related agreement) is unfair to the debtor because of one or more of three specified matters [16]. These matters are extremely broad and include not only any of the terms of the agreement but also anything done (or not done) by, or on behalf of, the creditor (either before or after the making of the agreement) [22]. In judging unfairness, the court must consider the whole history of the relationship and have regard to any matter that it thinks relevant [23]. But, if the relationship is still continuing, the question to be decided is not whether the relationship between the creditor and the debtor was unfair to the debtor when the credit agreement was made or at some other time in the past; it is whether the relationship is unfair to the debtor, ie at the time when the assessment is made [19]. Section 140A(4) makes it clear that, where the relationship has ended, the relevant time is the time when the relationship ended [20]-[21]. If the court finds that the relationship is (or was at the time when it ended) unfair to the debtor, the court then has a broad discretion to decide what, if any, remedial order to make. The purpose of any such order is to remove the cause(s) of the unfairness which the court has identified, if they are still continuing, and to reverse any damaging financial consequences to the debtor of that unfairness, so that the relationship as a whole can no longer be regarded as unfair [22]-[25]. RBS does not now dispute that in each case its failure to disclose the commission that it received made the relationship arising out of the credit agreement (taken with the related PPI agreement) unfair to the claimant and that, if the claim was brought in time, the remedial order made in the case of Ms Smith was one which the court was entitled to make [30]. Its main argument is that the claims are barred by section 9 of the Limitation Act 1980 because they are claims to recover money brought “after the expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued” [31]. RBS has argued that the “cause of action” (ie the right to claim a remedy) accrued when each of PPI payment was made. As the last such payment was made in, respectively, April 2006 (by Ms Smith) and March 2008 (by Mr Burrell), the six year time limit had expired in each case long before their claims were brought in 2019 [32]. The Supreme Court rejects this argument (as did the Court of Appeal). In each case the right to claim a remedy depends on whether the relationship was unfair to the claimant at the time when the relationship ended (see above). Therefore, the cause of action did not accrue, and the six year period for bringing a claim did not commence, until the credit relationship ended (in 2015 and 2019, respectively) [42]-[45]. It follows that both claims were brought in time. As an alternative argument, RBS relied on the Court of Appeal’s reasoning. This was that the claims are time-barred because “the relevant unfair relationship came to an end” when the last PPI payment was made (in April 2006 in the case of Ms Smith) [65]. In the Court’s view, this confuses the question of when the relationship came to an end with the different question of when (if at all before it came to an end) the relationship ceased to be unfair. The Court of Appeal recognised, correctly, that, after a credit relationship has ended, the fairness of the relationship must be judged at the point in time when the relationship came to an end (ie in 2015 for Ms Smith and 2019 for Mr Burrell) [65]. It is a further substantive question going to the merits of the claim whether the relationship between RBS and Ms Smith, although still continuing, ceased to be unfair to her after she made her last PPI payment in April 2006 [65]. The Court of Appeal thought that it did on the ground that there was no case, alleged or proved, that any economic effect of the PPI agreement for Ms Smith persisted after April 2006 [66]. The Supreme Court disagrees. The relationship remained unfair to Ms Smith after April 2006 because RBS did not repay any of the sums which she had paid for PPI cover (a persisting economic effect), nor did it disclose to her the existence let alone the amount of the commission that it had received out of those payments. This was still the position when Ms Smith’s relationship with RBS ended in 2015 [66]-[67]. The same applied in Mr Burrell’s case. The Court also confirms that the Court of Appeal was right to reject a further and separate argument made by RBS that the claims were excluded by the transitional provisions that applied when sections 140A–C of the 1974 Act were brought into effect [81]-[84]. Lord Hodge concurs with Lord Leggatt’s reasoning and conclusions, further explaining that the fact that the six year period for bringing a claim does not start to run until the credit relationship ends does not unduly expose RBS and other creditors to stale claims. This is because the court always has a discretion as to what, if any, remedy to grant. If a debtor sits on his or her hands with knowledge of the relevant facts, it would be, as Lord Leggatt states, inconceivable that a court would think it just to make an order under section 140B of the 1974 Act [89].			
2023	uksc-2022-0007	Commissioners for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (Appellants) v Vermilion Holdings Ltd (Respondent) (Scotland)	This case is concerned with the meaning of section 471 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (“ITEPA”). That section sets out when an option to acquire securities (which includes shares in a company) is granted “by reason of employment” and therefore subject to income tax rather than capital gains tax. In 2006, Vermilion Holdings Ltd (“Vermilion”) granted an option to Quest Advantage Ltd (“Quest”) to acquire shares in Vermilion (the “2006 Option”). By the end of 2006, it became clear that Vermilion was underperforming. As part of a rescue funding package, Vermilion and Quest agreed to amend the 2006 Option. In July 2007, Vermilion and Quest entered into a new option agreement (the “2007 Option”), under which Quest subscribed for a new class of shares in Vermilion and the 2006 Option expired. In 2016, Quest transferred the 2007 Option to Mr Noble. Quest asked His Majesty’s Revenue and Custom (“HMRC”) to confirm that this transfer was subject to capital gains tax. HMRC disagreed, informing Quest that it was subject to income tax as it had been granted to Mr Noble because of his employment as a director of Quest. Quest challenged HMRC’s decision in the First Tier Tribunal (the “FTT”). The FTT found that the 2007 Option was not granted by reason of Mr Noble’s employment. HRMC appealed this finding to the Upper Tribunal, which overturned the FTT’s decision. This was then subsequently appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session, which, by majority, found in favour of Vermillon. HMRC has now appealed that decision to the UK Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. It holds that, under section 471(3) ITEPA 2003, Mr Noble is deemed to have acquired the securities option because of his employment as a director of Quest and it is therefore subject to income tax.	The Court explains that the purpose of section 471 ITEPA 2003 is to define the circumstances in which the exercise of a securities option is subject to income tax instead of capital gains tax [21]. Section 471 does this in two ways. First, the grant of a securities option will be subject to income tax where it “is available by reason of an employment of that person or any other person”. To answer this question, a decision-maker must carefully consider the facts of each case to decide whether there is a causal connection between the person’s employment and the grant of the option [21] – [22]. However, that analysis is difficult and may give rise to disagreements among judges. To avoid such difficulties, section 471(3) creates a straightforward rule: if a person’s employer (or a person connected to that person’s employer) provides the employee with an option, that option is conclusively treated as having been made available by reason of their employment [24]. However, under that same section, a person will be exempt from this rule where both limbs of the following test are satisfied: (a) the person is an individual and (b) the option was granted in the normal course of the domestic, family, or personal relationships of that person. In applying section 471(3) in this case the key question was: did Vermilion confer the 2007 Option on Mr Noble while it was his employer? The answer is that it did [21]. As Mr Noble did not satisfy the exception in section 471(3), there was no need to undertake a more detailed analysis under section 471(1). The option is therefore conclusively treated as having been granted to Mr Noble because of his employment and subject to income tax [24] – [33]. The Court also states that section 471(3) should not be applied in a way that would produce unjust, absurd, or anomalous results [23] – [26], [33]. However, the Court concludes that applying section 471(3) produced no such result in this case [26].			
2023	uksc-2022-0021-0168	R (on the application of Afzal) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) R (on the application of Iyieke) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent)	Each of the appeals concerns the question whether the appellant, Mr Afzal and Mr Iyieke, respectively, is entitled to be granted indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom (“ILR”). The respondent, the Home Secretary, had granted Mr Afzal leave to remain until 14 July 2017. On 6 July 2017, Mr Afzal submitted an application for further leave to remain along with an application for waiver of the relevant fee. On 18 October 2017 the Home Secretary rejected Mr Afzal’s application to waive the fee and notified him that he had to pay the applicable fee together with the Immigration Health Surcharge (the “IHS”) payable under the Immigration (Health Charge) Order 2015 (SI 2015/792) (the “2015 Order”). Mr Afzal subsequently paid the application fee but omitted to pay the IHS as required. Since the IHS remained unpaid, on 22 January 2018 the Home Secretary rejected Mr Afzal’s application. Mr Afzal did not challenge this decision. Instead, on 2 February 2018 Mr Afzal made a fresh application for further leave to remain, accompanied by the relevant fee and the IHS. On 5 September 2019, the Home Secretary granted leave to remain until 4 March 2022. On 28 February 2020, having resided in the United Kingdom for more than 10 years, Mr Afzal applied for ILR pursuant to para 276B of the Immigration Rules (Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules) (1994) (HC 395)) (the “Immigration Rules”) on the ground of long residence, relying so far as necessary on section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971. Section 3C extends leave, in circumstances where an in-time application is made for variation of the leave, until the application is decided or withdrawn. The ILR application was refused on the grounds that there was a gap in his continuous lawful residence in the period between 14 July 2017 and 5 September 2019 where his presence in the United Kingdom had been unlawful as being without leave to remain. In respect of Mr Iyieke, the Home Secretary had granted him leave to remain until 9 August 2014. Mr Iyieke did not submit a further application to extend his leave beyond that date and became an overstayer on 10 August 2014. He then submitted an out of time application on 2 September 2014 for leave to remain on compassionate grounds which was refused. He then submitted an application for leave to remain on family and private life grounds on 26 February 2015 which was also refused, but the Upper Tribunal allowed his appeal. The Home Secretary therefore granted Mr Iyieke leave to remain until 11 February 2020, and then, on a further application by Mr Iyieke, until 30 July 2022. On 17 February 2021, having been resident for more than 10 years in the United Kingdom, Mr Iyieke applied for ILR pursuant to para 276B of the Immigration Rules. This application was refused. Mr Afzal issued a judicial review claim to challenge the Home Secretary’s decision against his ILR application. Permission to claim judicial review was refused by the Upper Tribunal. On appeal, the Court of Appeal granted permission but dismissed his claim on the merits: [2021] EWCA Civ 1909. Mr Iyieke also issued a judicial review claim to challenge the Home Secretary’s decision against his ILR application. Permission to claim judicial review was refused by a differently constituted Upper Tribunal. On appeal, a differently constituted Court of Appeal granted permission but dismissed his claim on the merits: [2022] EWCA Civ 1147. Mr Afzal and Mr Iyieke now appeal to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses each of the appeals. Lord Sales gives the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.	Mr Afzal’s appeal Mr Afzal’s period of overstaying between 14 July 2017 and 5 September 2019 breaks his period of 10 years continuous lawful residence as required under para 276B(i)(a), meaning that he cannot satisfy the conditions for a grant of ILR, unless para 39E(2)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Rules applies. Under para 39E(2)(b)(ii), the period of overstaying is “disregarded” (under para 276B(v)) where the application was made within 14 days of the expiry of any leave extended by section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 [35]. By virtue of article 6(1) of the 2015 Order, where a person fails to comply with the requirement to pay the IHS in connection with their application the Home Secretary has a discretion to request the applicant to pay the outstanding charge. That discretion was exercised so Mr Afzal had to pay the outstanding IHS charge within 10 working days of the date (18 October 2017) when the request was sent. Upon his failure to do so, article 6 required the Home Secretary to treat his application for leave as invalid at that point (31 October 2017). Mr Afzal was entitled to rely on section 3C for an extension of his leave only until then [58], [64]. Mr Afzal’s subsequent application on 2 February 2018 was therefore not made within 14 days of the expiry of that extension of his leave, with the result that he was not lawfully present between 14 July 2017 and 5 September 2019. This broke the period of continuous lawful residence for the purposes of his ILR application [65]. If the period was not broken in this way, a second question arose as to the meaning of “disregarded” under para 276B(v) of the Immigration Rules because, in order to be able to establish at least 10 years of continuous lawful residence, Mr Afzal needs to be able to add the period of overstaying, which he says falls to be “disregarded” under para 276B(v), to his periods of lawful residence either side of it [38]. Having regard in particular to the natural meaning of “disregarded”, the Court holds that this period of overstaying cannot be added to the periods of lawful residence either side of it to make up a total of 10 years lawful residence [70]-[71], [79]. Mr Iyieke’s appeal There was a gap of 111 days between the expiry of the first period of leave (9 August 2014) and the date of the commencement of Mr Iyieke’s second period of leave to remain. The commencement date of this second period was backdated to 28 November 2014 for the purposes of counting continuous lawful residence following Mr Iyieke’s successful appeal in the Upper Tribunal in respect of his application made on 26 February 2015 on family and private life grounds. If the resulting gap period falls to be disregarded under para 276B(v)(a), Mr Iyieke can establish that he has the necessary period of continuous lawful residence for a grant of ILR [83]. For the gap period to be disregarded, his (unsuccessful) application of 2 September 2014 for leave to remain must qualify as “the previous application” referred to in para 276B(v)(a) [84]. The Court holds that it does not so qualify. The use of the definite article in the phrase “the previous application” shows that only one particular application is being referred to, which must be the application which successfully resulted in the grant of the second period of leave and which marked the end of the period of overstaying [86]. To hold otherwise would have the perverse effect of making it more advantageous to submit an application out of time which it cannot reasonably be thought the drafter intended [88].			
2023	uksc-2022-0022	R (on the application of Worcestershire County Council) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for Health and Social Care (Respondent)	In March 2014, 'JG' was detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (the Act) for treatment in hospital in Worcester (the first detention).  Under section 117 of the Act, local authorities have a duty to provide 'after-care services' for people, such as JG, who leave hospital after a period of compulsory detention. 'After-care services' are healthcare and social care services, often including accommodation, which meet a person's needs arising from their mental disorder and which aim to reduce the risk of being readmitted to hospital. The duty is imposed on the local authority for the area in which the person concerned was 'ordinarily resident' immediately before being detained (see section 117(3)(a)).  JG was 'ordinarily resident' in Worcester before her first detention and Worcestershire County Council (Worcestershire) was therefore obliged to provide her with after-care services on her discharge from hospital in July 2014 (the first discharge).  JG was assessed as lacking capacity to decide where to live on discharge. Following consultation with her daughter and others involved with her care, it was considered in JG's best interests for her to live near her daughter. Worcestershire therefore placed JG in a residential care home in Swindon.  In June 2015, as a result of deteriorating mental health, JG was detained again under section 3 for treatment in hospital, but this time in Swindon (the second detention).  When JG left hospital in August 2017 (the second discharge), a dispute arose between Worcestershire and Swindon Borough Council (Swindon) as to which of them was responsible for providing her with after-care services.  Worcestershire and Swindon referred the dispute to the Secretary of State who decided that Worcestershire was responsible [17]-[19]. Worcestershire sought judicial review of this decision. At first instance, the High Court decided that Swindon was responsible: [2021] EWHC 682 (Admin). The Court of Appeal reached the opposite conclusion: [2021] EWCA Civ 1957. Worcestershire now appeals from that decision to the Supreme Court. The Secretary of State cross-appeals seeking to uphold the decision of the Court of Appeal on a different ground from that which the Court of Appeal gave [20]-[21].	The Supreme Court unanimously allows Worcestershire's appeal and rejects the Secretary of State's cross-appeal. It declares that, following the second discharge, Swindon, and not Worcestershire, had a duty to provide after-care services for JG under section 117 of the Act. Lord Hamblen and Lord Leggatt, with whom the other Justices agree, give the court's judgment.	(i) Worcestershire's appeal  It was common ground that, following the first discharge, the duty to provide after-care services for JG was owed by Worcestershire because JG had been 'ordinarily resident' in Worcestershire 'immediately before being detained' [26]. Under s. 117(2), the duty exists 'until such time as' the relevant authorities 'are satisfied that the person concerned is no longer in need of such services'. At no time did Worcestershire make a decision that JG was no longer in need of after-care services [27]. On this basis, the Secretary of State argued, and the Court of Appeal accepted, that the duty of Worcestershire to provide after-care services for JG continued even after the second detention and second discharge and that this prevented such a duty from being imposed upon Swindon [35].  By contrast, Worcestershire submitted as its primary case that, upon the second discharge, Swindon owed a duty to provide after-care services for JG because JG had been 'ordinarily resident' in Swindon immediately before the second detention, and it was agreed that, where there has been more than one period of detention, the words 'immediately before being detained' must refer to the most recent period of detention [28]. Worcestershire further submitted that, in these circumstances, its own duty must be taken to have ended when Swindon's duty arose upon the second discharge [32]-[33].  The court did not accept either conclusion. Neither party's analysis explained why the first (Worcestershire's) or the second (Swindon's) duty should oust the other. Each party's case rests on no more than an assertion that its preferred duty trumps the other without identifying any basis in the language of the statute for reaching this conclusion [40]. Further, the court was unpersuaded that the possible practical difficulties of either approach were of any assistance in interpreting the relevant statutory provision [43].  However, the court considered that Worcestershire's alternative case provided the answer. This is that the duty to provide after-care services ends when an individual is compulsorily detained in hospital for treatment [44].  This interpretation is grounded in the language and purpose of section 117: (i) upon a person's second detention, he/she is no longer a person who has 'ceased to be detained' but a person who is detained and is in hospital; (ii) it is implicit in the concept of 'after-care' that the duty does not apply to people who are currently detained receiving treatment in hospital but only to persons who have left hospital; and (iii) the purpose of after-care, to reduce the risk of readmission, makes no sense in the context of a person who has already been readmitted to hospital [45]-[53].  Therefore, Worcestershire's duty to provide after-care services ended upon JG's second detention. Upon her second discharge a new duty to provide such services arose. Which local authority owed that duty depends on where JG was 'ordinarily resident' immediately before the second detention. Both courts below held that this was Swindon but the Secretary of State challenged that conclusion by his cross-appeal [54].  (ii) The Secretary of State's cross-appeal  The Secretary of State argued that Worcestershire's placement of JG in a care home in Swindon did not change, as a matter of law, where she was 'ordinarily resident' which at all times remained Worcestershire [23].  'Ordinary residence' must be (i) voluntarily adopted i.e. not enforced presence by reason of, for example, kidnapping or imprisonment; and (ii) for settled purposes: R v Barnet London Borough Council, Ex p Shah [1983] 2 AC 309, 343 [56].  Although JG lacked mental capacity to decide where to live, the decision to live in Swindon was still made voluntarily as it was the result of a choice made by those with the power to make decisions on her behalf. Further, her residence in Swindon was also adopted for settled purposes. Thus, on its plain meaning, JG was 'ordinarily resident' in Swindon before her second detention [58].  The Secretary of State argued that the words 'ordinarily resident' in this context do not bear their usual meaning but are subject to a special rule of law that, if the accommodation in which a person is living is provided by a local authority for the purpose of performing its statutory duty under section 117 of the Act, then residence in that place should be disregarded in determining where he/she is 'ordinarily resident' for the purpose of section 117 [59]. This rule was said to follow from the decision of the Supreme Court in R (Cornwall County Council) v Secretary of State for Health [2015] UKSC 46, [2016] AC 137 [60]-[69].  The Court rejected this argument on grounds that: (i) the Cornwall decision should not be extended beyond the specific statutory context under review in that case [70]; (ii) there is nothing in section 117 of the Act to suggest that the term 'ordinarily resident' should be given anything other than its usual meaning [71]; and (iii) the argument is contrary to the decision of the Court of Appeal in R (Hertfordshire County Council) v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council [2011] EWCA Civ 77 and nothing in Cornwall or the amendment of section 117 by the Care Act 2014 cast doubt of the correctness of that decision; indeed they confirm it [72]-[86].			
2023	uksc-2022-0046	Wolverhampton City Council and others (Respondents) v London Gypsies and Travellers and others (Appellants)	This appeal concerns injunctions obtained by local authorities to prevent unauthorised encampments by Gypsies and Travellers. An injunction is a court order that requires the persons to whom it is addressed to do, or refrain from doing, a specified act. In this appeal, the Supreme Court is asked to decide whether the court has the power to grant injunctions against persons who are unknown and unidentified at the date of the grant of the injunction, and who have not yet performed, or even threatened to perform, the acts which the injunction prohibits. These persons are known as “newcomers” and the injunctions made against them as “newcomer injunctions”. Between 2015 and 2020, 38 different local authorities, or groups of local authorities, obtained injunctions designed to prevent Gypsies and Travellers from camping on local authority land without permission. The local authorities relied on a range of statutory provisions, including section 187B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 which enables the court to grant an injunction to restrain an actual or anticipated breach of planning control. Some of the local authorities also relied on common law causes of action, such as trespass. The injunctions were addressed to “persons unknown” because the Gypsies and Travellers who might wish to camp on a particular site could not generally be identified in advance. At the time the injunctions were granted, these unknown persons, or newcomers, had not yet committed, or threatened to commit, any breach of planning control, trespass or other relevant unlawful activity. The local authorities obtained the injunctions without notifying any other party, at hearings where the interests of Gypsies and Travellers were not represented. Once obtained, copies of the injunctions were displayed in prominent locations on each of the relevant sites. From around mid-2020, the local authorities made applications to extend or vary injunctions which were coming to an end. After a hearing in one of these cases, the High Court judge decided that there was a need to review all newcomer injunctions affecting Gypsies and Travellers. He gave the appellants – (i) London Gypsies and Travellers, (ii) Friends, Families and Travellers, and (iii) Derbyshire Gypsy Liaison Group – permission to intervene so that the interests of Gypsies and Travellers could be represented. Following the review hearing, the judge concluded that the court did not have the power to grant newcomer injunctions, except on a short-term, interim basis. He therefore made a series of orders discharging the newcomer injunctions obtained by the local authorities. The Court of Appeal held that the court had the power to grant newcomer injunctions, and allowed the local authorities’ appeal. The appellants now appeal to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appellants’ appeal. It holds that the court has power to grant newcomer injunctions. However, it should only exercise this power in circumstances where there is a compelling need to protect civil rights or to enforce public law that is not adequately met by any other available remedies. In addition, newcomer injunctions should only be made subject to procedural safeguards designed to protect newcomers’ rights. Lord Reed, Lord Briggs and Lord Kitchin give a joint judgment, with which the other members of the Court agree.	Newcomer injunctions are a wholly new form of injunction, which are granted without prior notice against persons who cannot be known at the time the order is made. They therefore potentially apply to anyone in the world [142]-[144]. In the context of Gypsies and Travellers, newcomer injunctions are generally made in cases where the affected Gypsies and Travellers are unlikely to have any right or liberty to set up unauthorised encampments on the relevant local authority land. The injunctions therefore seek to enforce the local authorities’ legal rights in proceedings where there is no real dispute to be resolved. Experience has shown that the usual processes of eviction, or even injunction, against named Gypsies and Travellers are inadequate because, by the time the local authority has commenced proceedings, the original group will often have left and been replaced by others, against whom the proceedings are of no effect. Local authorities therefore seek newcomer injunctions because they provide an effective means of vindicating their legal rights. Even when they are interim in form, newcomer injunctions operate in substance against newcomers on a medium to long-term basis, rather than as an emergency short-term measure to protect local authorities’ rights pending a later trial process [139], [142]-[144]. The court has jurisdiction, or power, to grant newcomer injunctions because its power to grant injunctions is unlimited, subject to any relevant statutory restrictions. The power is equitable in origin, and has been confirmed and restated by Parliament in section 37(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 [16]-[18], [145]-[146]. The court’s power to grant injunctions is not limited to pre-existing, established categories. Injunctions may be granted in new circumstances as and when required by the principles of justice and equity which underpin them. This is demonstrated by the courts’ development of several new kinds of injunction over the last 50 years, including freezing injunctions, search orders, third party disclosure orders, internet blocking orders, and anti-suit injunctions [19]-[22], [147]-[148]. The question for the Supreme Court is, therefore, whether the court should, as a matter of principle and practice, grant newcomer injunctions and, if so, on what basis and subject to what safeguards. The Court answers this question by reference to equitable principles, which derive from the important role of equity in putting right defects or inadequacies in the common law. First, where there is a right, there should be a remedy to fit that right. Secondly, equity looks to the substance rather than the form. Thirdly, equity operates flexibly and responds to changes in circumstances over time. Fourthly, subject to the requirements of justice and convenience, equity is not constrained by any limiting rule in fashioning a remedy to suit new circumstances [149]-[153], [238 (iii)]. The Court considers, and rejects, a number of objections to the grant of newcomer injunctions [23]-[56], [154]-[166], [168]-[185]. It concludes that there is no reason why newcomer injunctions should never be granted, in principle. Newcomer injunctions are a valuable and proportionate remedy in appropriate cases. However, this does not mean that it will be appropriate for the court to grant a newcomer injunction in every case. In deciding whether it should grant a newcomer injunction, the court should have regard to the equitable principles described above, which require that newcomer injunctions should only be granted in certain circumstances, and subject to certain safeguards [167], [186], [237]-[238]. The applicable principles and safeguards will evolve over time in the light of the experience of the courts where applications for newcomer injunctions are made [187]. However, newcomer injunctions to prohibit unauthorised encampments by Gypsies and Travellers are only likely to be justified if, first, the applicant local authority has demonstrated that, on the available evidence, there is a compelling need to protect civil rights or enforce public law that is not adequately met by any other remedies [167(i)], [188]-[220], [238(iv)(a)]. Secondly, because newcomer injunctions are made without notifying the affected newcomers, procedural safeguards must be built into both the application and the court order. The application for the injunction should be advertised widely so that those likely to be affected by it (or bodies representing their interests like the appellants) are given a fair opportunity to make representations before the injunction is made. Once the injunction has been granted, it must be displayed in a prominent location at the affected site. Newcomers who become aware of it should have notified clearly to them the right to apply to court to have it varied or set aside, without having to show that circumstances have changed [167(ii)], [226]-[232], [238(iv)(b)]. Thirdly, because the interests of Gypsies and Travellers are not typically represented at the hearings where newcomer injunctions are granted, the applicant local authorities will be obliged to comply with a strict duty which requires them to disclose to the court (after due research) any matter which a newcomer might raise to oppose the making of the order [167(iii)], [219], [238(iv)(c)]. Fourthly, newcomer injunctions should be limited so that they do not apply for a disproportionately long time period or to a disproportionately wide geographical area [167(iv)], [225], [238(iv)(b)]. Finally, the court must be satisfied that it is, on the particular facts of the case, just and convenient that a newcomer injunction is granted [167(v)], [238(iv)(d)].			
2023	uksc-2022-0048	Byers and others (Appellant) v Saudi National Bank (Respondent)	Between 2002 and 2008, Mr Al-Sanea acquired shares in five Saudi Arabian companies (the “Shares”). He held the Shares on trust for (i.e., for the benefit of) Saad Investments Company Limited (“SICL”). In September 2009, Mr Al-Sanea transferred the Shares to Samba Financial Group (“Samba”) in breach of the terms of the trust in favour of SICL (the “Transfer”). There is a distinction in English law between: (i) legal title to property (being, in this case, the title held in the Shares by Mr Al-Sanea as trustee); and (ii) equitable interest in property (being, in this case, the interest in trust property held by SICL as beneficiary of the trust). However, the governing law of the Transfer was Saudi Arabian law, which does not recognise this distinction. As a result, the effect of the Transfer under Saudi Arabian law was to extinguish SICL’s equitable interest in the Shares. Samba therefore became the sole owner of the Shares following the Transfer. In September 2009, SICL went into liquidation. In May 2017, SICL and its joint liquidators made a claim for knowing receipt against Samba, alleging that it received trust property in the knowledge that the property was transferred in breach of trust. In April 2021, Samba’s assets and liabilities were transferred to Saudi National Bank (“SNB”). The High Court of England and Wales dismissed SICL’s claim. It concluded that, as SICL’s equitable interest in the property had been extinguished, it was not possible to make a claim for knowing receipt. SICL appealed to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, which dismissed SICL’s appeal. SICL then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses SICL’s appeal. It holds that a claim for knowing receipt cannot be made if a claimant’s equitable interest in the property in question has been extinguished by the time of the defendant’s knowing receipt of the property. The Supreme Court delivers three judgments: (i) Lord Hodge, (ii) Lord Briggs, and (iii) Lord Burrows. In his judgment, Lord Hodge (with whom Lord Leggatt and Lord Stephens agree) provides a summary of the matters agreed by both Lord Briggs and Lord Burrows as determining the outcome of the appeal. The detailed reasons are to be found in Lord Briggs’ and Lord Burrows’ judgments.	Although the case law points toward the Supreme Court’s conclusion, it does not provide a definitive answer in this case. The Supreme Court therefore concludes that it must decide the matter by applying equitable principles [1], [116], [143]. The applicable principles are the following. First, the transfer of property by a trustee in breach of trust to a purchaser acting in good faith and without notice of the breach of trust (referred to as a “bona fide purchaser for value without notice”) extinguishes or overrides the equitable interest held in that property by the beneficiary of the trust [2], [18], [20], [156]. Second, if the bona fide purchaser for value without notice later becomes aware that the property was transferred in breach of trust, that does not revive the equitable interest. That interest also is not revived when the original bona fide purchaser for value without notice transfers the property to a further recipient, who, at the time of the transfer, is aware that there has been a breach of trust [3], [23] – [24], [167] – [171]. Third, it is well established that a claimant cannot make a claim for knowing receipt in either of these two situations because their equitable interest in the property has been extinguished or overridden [4], [23] – [24], [172], [201]. Fourth, a claim for dishonest assistance (i.e., a claim against a non-trustee who induces or assists the breach of trust by a trustee) is not comparable to a claim for knowing receipt. Dishonest assistance is ancillary to the breach of trust by a trustee and is an accessory wrong (i.e., one is assisting the primary wrong which is the breach of trust), whereas knowing receipt is closely linked to a claim which attaches to the trust property (referred to as a “proprietary claim”). A personal claim for knowing receipt against a recipient who is not a bona fide purchaser for value without notice may be engaged where a proprietary claim would fail because the recipient no longer has the property. This may be because the recipient has transferred, dissipated, or destroyed the property after learning of the claimant’s equitable interest in it.[5], [41] – [42], [46], [145] – [149]. Fifth, the extinction or overriding of an equitable interest in property by the time the recipient receives the property prevents a claimant from bringing a proprietary claim against the recipient. Given the close link between a claim for knowing receipt and a proprietary claim, it would be logically inconsistent to allow a claim for knowing receipt to survive where a proprietary claim does not, in a case where (as here) the recipient has not dissipated or disposed of the property. [6], [44], [158] – [159], [172], [201]. Applying these principles to the facts of this case, the Supreme Court concludes that, as Saudi Arabian law extinguished SICL’s equitable interest in the Shares at the time of their transfer to Samba, SICL cannot make a claim for knowing receipt against SNB in respect of the Shares [1], [6], [97], [201]. Lord Briggs and Lord Burrows set out their reasoning in separate judgments. The primary difference in their reasoning is that Lord Briggs analyses a claim in knowing receipt as ancillary to a proprietary claim, while Lord Burrows categorises a claim in knowing receipt as an equitable proprietary wrong [8], [42], [46], [151], [157] – [159]. The judgment of Lord Briggs is principally based on a review of the basic equitable principles that are engaged by a claim in knowing receipt, and an analysis of how such principles regulate the question of which interests prevail where two or more come into apparent conflict [17] – [18], [38] – [40], [43]. Lord Burrows’ judgment proceeds from the essential nature of a claim in knowing receipt as an equitable wrong rooted in the claimant’s continuing proprietary interest and examines how the logical consequences of its application in a range of factual circumstances confirm this as the correct legal view [151], [167] – [171], [188], [196].			
2023	uksc-2022-0052	R (on the application of Pearce and another) (Respondents) v Parole Board for England and Wales (Appellant)	The Parole Board for England and Wales ("the Board") is responsible for deciding whether or not to direct the early release of prisoners serving various categories of sentences of imprisonment. When making its decision, the Board must be satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should remain in custody. One example of that test is to be found in section 28(6)(b) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 ("the Statutory Question").  In March 2019, the Board issued its "Guidance on Allegations" ("the Guidance") concerning the correct approach to take, when answering the Statutory Question, with respect to allegations made about the prisoner beyond offences of which they were convicted. Sometimes such allegations have not been proved or disproved on the balance of probabilities but, if true, could affect the Boards risk analysis. The Guidance directed the Board to "make an assessment of the allegation to decide whether and how to take it into account". The Guidance further provided that "in cases where there is a mere allegation without any factual basis… or the allegation is not relevant to the question of risk… [it] should be disregarded."  On 13 October 2010, Mr Pearce was sentenced to imprisonment for public protection with a minimum term of three and a half years (less time spent on remand) following conviction for sexual assaults. On its most recent review of his imprisonment in May 2019, the Board refused to direct Mr Pearce's release ("the Decision"). In accordance with the Guidance, when addressing the Statutory Question the Board took into account a number of allegations of other sexual assaults and Mr Pearce's responses when questioned about them.  Mr Pearce challenged the Decision and the Guidance by way of judicial review, arguing that, in the absence of findings of fact, an allegation is simply a "non-fact" and, as such, it is not permissible for the Board to pay any attention to it at all. The High Court dismissed Mr Pearce's claim. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the parts of the Guidance which countenanced the carrying out of a risk assessment by reference to allegations which had not been proved were unlawful. However, the Decision itself was held to have been proper and justified on the facts.  The Board appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Court of Appeal was wrong to hold that parts of the Guidance were unlawful.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal, but nevertheless invites the Board to review the terms of the Guidance. Lord Hodge and Lord Hughes give the judgment, with which Lord Kitchin, Lord Hamblen and Lord Richards agree.	The Supreme Court notes that the question raised by this appeal is one of statutory interpretation. The Board's statutory remit is that it may not release a prisoner unless it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that they remain in custody. The central question is whether there is anything in the legal context of the Board's role which limits it to only taking into account proven facts of past behaviour, while excluding from consideration in any circumstance the possibility that any unproven allegations made against the prisoner might be true [14]; [29]; [72]-[73].  The Supreme Court holds that there is no such limitation. There is therefore no requirement to be implied in the statutory test that the Board must disregard the possibility that an unproven allegation may be true [73].  Firstly, the Supreme Court rejects the suggestion that the law knows only a binary approach of fact or non-fact [30]-[65]. As a general rule in civil proceedings, only "facts in issue" (those facts which it is necessary to prove in order to establish a claim or defence) must be established on the balance of probabilities [32]-[34]; [38]. Not every fact is a fact in issue. Facts which are part of the material from which a fact in issue may be inferred do not need to be proved individually [34]. Evidence which is not sufficient to establish a fact on the balance of probabilities may still be relevant when the judicial body assesses the weight of other evidence in deciding whether a fact in issue is established [35]-[38].  It is well settled law that if a care order is sought under section 31(2) of the Children Act 1989 based on an allegation that a previous child was harmed in a specific way by one or both of the parents, that allegation must be proved on the balance of probabilities. However, that rule is specific to the care order regime. It is mandated by the different language of the Children Act, and even in that context there is at least one situation in which an unproven possibility that a parent has harmed a child can be taken into account. The question whether the State is entitled to remove a child from home and family is not analogous to the question whether a prisoner who remains subject to a sentence can safely be released [47]-[64].  The Supreme Court holds that, similarly, risk may be assessed without the judicial body being able to find proven every foundation fact [34]-[46]. Depending upon the legal context, the judicial body can assess risk by weighing up the possibility that an allegation may be true having regard to the whole material before it [39]-[42]; [44]-[46]; [60]-[62].  Secondly, while the Board must comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the conduct of its proceedings and keep in mind the consequences to the prisoner of its decision, the Supreme Court finds no basis for the contention that fairness requires the Board to have regard only to proven facts in making its assessment [66]-[67]; [69]-[71]. Substantive fairness does not require a judicial body to treat as if they were facts in issue information which, on a proper analysis, is not of that nature [68].  The Supreme Court invites the Board to review the Guidance in light of its judgment, to make clear that the Board should, if it reasonably can, make relevant findings of fact [74]; [89]. If an allegation could, if true, affect the Board's risk assessment, the Board's task, so far as it can, is to explore the nature of that allegation and its surrounding circumstances in order to make findings of fact where it is reasonably practicable to do so [74].  Where the Board is not in a position to make findings of fact, either because there is insufficient material available, or it would not be fair to do so (because, for example, the prisoner may properly decline to respond to an allegation which is the subject of a pending criminal investigation or prosecution), but is concerned that there is a serious possibility that an allegation may be true, the Board may still take that allegation into account and give it such weight as it considers appropriate in a holistic assessment of all the information before it [76]-[77]; [87]; [90]. In those circumstances, procedural fairness would require the Board to give the prisoner the opportunity to state their position in relation to the allegation and to argue that no or very little account should be taken of it [66]-[67]; [70]; [87]; [90]. An oral hearing may also be required if the allegation is likely to be material to the risk assessment or if issues of explanation or mitigation are likely to arise [75]. The Board's assessment of the weight to be attached to an allegation is subject to the constraints of public law rationality [87]; [93].  The Board may also be persuaded that it is not safe to release the prisoner based on the surrounding facts: in some cases, the number and nature of allegations from independent sources might justify the Board in concluding that the prisoner has engaged in a course of conduct giving rise to a risk to the public even if no single one of the allegations is found proven. In other cases, a holistic assessment of all the circumstances may persuade the Board that there is a significant chance, short of the balance of probability, that an allegation is true [79]; [83]. Further, where the Board cannot make a finding as to the truth of an allegation, the allegation can also be used to test the credibility of the prisoner's account of their behaviour [78].  The Supreme Court notes that there may be circumstances where, because of the inadequacy of the information, the Board concludes that it should not take account of an allegation at all [87].  Finally, the Supreme Court finds that the concept of a "mere allegation" (and the contrast made in the Guidance between that and an allegation for which there is "some factual basis") is unhelpful. This shifts the focus away from assessing the quality of the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the allegation [93].			
2023	uksc-2022-0056	Morgan and others (Respondents) v Ministry of Justice (Appellant) (Northern Ireland)	The respondents were convicted of terrorism offences. On 13 November 2020, they were sentenced to determinate custodial sentences by Colton J. In accordance with the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (the '2008 Order'), the judge specified a "custodial period" of half of the term of their sentences which gave rise to an obligation on the part of the Department of Justice to release the respondents on licence (e.g. living in the community while complying with set rules) when they had served half their sentences.  On 29 April 2021, the Counter Terrorism and Sentencing Act 2021 (the '2021 Act') received Royal Assent. Section 30 of the 2021 Act introduced Article 20A ('Article 20A') into the 2008 Order. Article 20A provided that prisoners convicted of certain terrorist offences would not be released from custody at the halfway point, but rather their cases would be referred at the two-thirds point to the Parole Commission which would not direct their release on licence unless satisfied that it was no longer necessary for the protection of the public that they should be confined. The end date of the respondents' determinate custodial sentences was unaltered.  The respondents challenged section 30 of the 2021 Act, which inserted Article 20A. On appeal to the Court of Appeal and insofar as relevant, they argued that:  The changes effected by Article 20A breached Article 5(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (the 'ECHR') as the change to their sentences was not foreseeable. The changes effected by Article 20A breached Article 7(1) of the ECHR as it retrospectively changed the penalty for the offences committed. The Court of Appeal declared that section 30 of the 2021 Act, inserting Article 20A, was incompatible with Article 7(1) of the ECHR. Given that decision, it made no determination about Article 5 of the ECHR. The Court of Appeal considered that the changes to the respondents' sentences caused by Article 20A were a redefinition or modification of the scope of the penalty imposed applied retrospectively in breach of Article 7 of the ECHR.  The appellant appealed the declaration of incompatibility with Article 7(1) of the ECHR, and the respondents were given permission to cross-appeal in relation to Article 5 of the ECHR. The issues for the Supreme Court were therefore the compatibility of section 30 of the 2021 Act, inserting Article 20A, with Articles 5 and 7 of the ECHR.	The Supreme Court allows the appellant's appeal in respect of Article 7 of the ECHR and sets aside the declaration of incompatibility made by the Court of Appeal. The respondents' cross appeal on Article 5 of the ECHR is dismissed.  The Supreme Court finds unanimously that section 30 of the 2021 Act, inserting Article 20A, is compatible with Article 7 and Article 5 of the ECHR. Lord Stephens gives the lead judgment with which all the other justices agree.	Article 7 of the ECHR  Article 7 of the ECHR distinguishes between redefinition or modification of a penalty (which is not permitted retrospectively) and changes to the manner of execution or enforcement of a penalty (which is permitted retrospectively under Article 7 of the ECHR). The key question was whether the changes effected by Article 20A redefined or modified the scope of the penalty, or whether they changed the manner of execution or enforcement of the penalty [105].  The Supreme Court found that section 30 of the 2021 Act, inserting Article 20A, changed the manner of execution or enforcement of the penalty and therefore did not breach Article 7 of the ECHR. Its reasons were:  The penalty was the determinate custodial sentence imposed [107]. Specifying the custodial period did not change the penalty imposed [112]. Judicial involvement does not mean that a measure is no longer a change to the manner of execution or enforcement of a penalty [110]. There has been no retroactive increase in the penalties imposed on the respondents. The changes effected by Article 20A concern only the way in which lawfully prescribed determinate custodial sentences are to be executed [116]. Article 5 of the ECHR  Article 5, insofar as relevant, ensures that no one shall be deprived of their liberty except in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law. The law authorising the detention must have a legal basis and must comply with the 'quality of law requirements', namely that the law authorising deprivation of liberty must be sufficiently accessible, precise, and foreseeable in its application [122].  The quality of law requirements in Article 5 of the ECHR apply to detention, with the effect that a measure which relates to the execution of a penalty (and therefore does not come within Article 7 of the ECHR) may authorise the deprivation of liberty (and therefore come within Article 5 of the ECHR and be required to meet the quality of law requirements in Article 5 of the ECHR) [121].  The Supreme Court therefore considered whether the changes effected by Article 20A complied with the quality of law requirements in Article 5 of the ECHR [123].  The Court concluded that the changes were compliant with Article 5 of the ECHR because:  The lawfulness of the respondents' detention was decided for the duration of the whole sentence, by the determinate custodial sentences imposed [125]. The respondents' expectation that they would be released on licence does not affect the lawfulness of that detention [126]. It is entirely foreseeable that the manner of the execution of the sentence might be changed by policy or legislation [127].			
2023	uksc-2022-0066	Skatteforvaltningen (the Danish Customs and Tax Administration) (Respondent) v Solo Capital Partners LLP (in special administration) and others (Appellants)	Skatteforvaltningen (“SKAT”), the Danish Customs and Tax Administration, has issued claims in England and Wales against a number of parties, including the appellants in this appeal. In its claims, SKAT alleges that these parties have submitted fraudulent applications for tax refunds to which they were never entitled. Non-residents of Denmark who receive dividends from Danish companies are liable to pay 27% tax on the dividends, which SKAT withholds when the dividends are first paid out. It is possible to apply for a refund of that tax in certain circumstances. SKAT alleges that the appellants owned no shares in any relevant Danish companies, received no dividends on any such shares and therefore could not have owed any tax or been owed any refunds: yet nevertheless they applied for and were paid tax refunds. SKAT claims that it has been induced to make payments to a value of about £1.44 billion as a result of these fraudulent applications. When SKAT brought proceedings in the Commercial Court in England and Wales, the appellants defended the claims on the basis that they were protected by a principle of private international law, under which claims which seek to enforce the tax law of a foreign state, whether directly or indirectly, are inadmissible before courts in this jurisdiction. This principle is known as the revenue rule. The Commercial Court considered as a preliminary issue whether the revenue rule applied. In April 2021, it held that SKAT’s claims fell within the scope of the rule and were therefore inadmissible. SKAT appealed to the Court of Appeal. In February 2022, the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Commercial Court. It held that SKAT’s claims did not fall within the scope of the revenue rule. This was because the money sought by SKAT was not unpaid tax or tax at all, but rather money which SKAT alleged had been taken by fraud. The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously rejects the appellants’ appeal. It holds that the revenue rule does not apply to SKAT’s claims. This means that SKAT’s claims against the appellants can proceed to a trial in the Commercial Court. Lord Lloyd-Jones gives a judgment with which the other members of the Court agree.	The Revenue Rule There is a well-established and almost universally applied principle that the courts of one country will not enforce the tax laws of another country. In general terms, the rule prevents direct enforcement, where a foreign state seeks to rely on its own law or rules to obtain the money or property sought, as well as indirect enforcement. Indirect enforcement includes claims where the foreign state seeks a remedy which is not formally based on foreign tax law, but is in substance designed to give that law effect outside the foreign state itself. [21] The Court accepts the argument made by SKAT that the revenue rule only applies to proceedings where there is an unsatisfied demand for tax which the foreign tax authority seeks to recover directly or indirectly. [36] Applying that conclusion to the facts of this case, SKAT’s claim is not for unpaid tax nor is it a claim that the appellants are liable to SKAT because they have cheated SKAT out of tax which was due to it. SKAT’s case is that the appellants have never been liable to pay any tax in Denmark. Instead, the substance of its claims is that the appellants defrauded SKAT to obtain refunds to which they were never entitled, and SKAT has brought its claims as a victim of fraud. Accordingly, SKAT’s claims fall outside the revenue rule. The fact that there are no taxes due from the appellants is a complete answer to their argument that the revenue rule applies. [37]–[39]. The Sovereign Authority Rule The appellants also argued that SKAT was barred from bringing a claim by virtue of the “sovereign authority rule”. This rule holds that the enforcement of a public law of a foreign state, whether directly or indirectly, is also inadmissible [53]. The Court also rejects the argument that SKAT’s claims involve acts of a sovereign or governmental character and that they should be dismissed for that reason [54]. While Denmark has exercised sovereign power in creating and operating its tax system, this merely provides the context for the present claims. The substance of the claims does not involve any act of a sovereign character, any exercise or enforcement of a sovereign right, or any vindication of sovereign power. SKAT, in seeking to recover money of which it alleges it has been defrauded, is following a course that would be open to any private individual who has been similarly defrauded [58].			
2023	uksc-2022-0075	Philipp (Respondent) v Barclays Bank UK PLC (Appellant)	In 2018 Mrs Fiona Philipp and her husband, Dr Robin Philipp, fell victim to a fraud. They were deceived by criminals into instructing Barclays Bank (the Bank) to transfer £700,000 in two payments from Mrs Philipp's current account with the Bank to bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates. The instructions were carried out and the money was lost.  In these proceedings Mrs Philipp claims that the Bank is responsible for this loss. She contends that the Bank owed her a duty under its contract with her or under common law not to carry out her payment instructions if - as is alleged - the Bank had reasonable grounds for believing that she was being defrauded.  The Bank applied to have the claim summarily dismissed on the ground that, as a matter of law, it did not owe Mrs Philipp the alleged duty. The High Court (Judge Russen QC) granted summary judgment in favour of the Bank: [2021] EWHC 10 (Comm). But the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by Mrs Philipp: [2022] EWCA Civ 318. The Court of Appeal accepted her legal argument that, in principle, a bank owes a duty to its customer of the kind alleged: whether such a duty arose on the facts in this case is a question which can only be decided at a trial. From that decision the Bank now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal, holding that the Bank did not owe the alleged duty to Mrs Philipp. The Court therefore restores the order of the judge granting the Bank summary judgment (but varies it to permit Mrs Philipp to maintain an alternative claim based on the Bank's alleged failure to act promptly to try to recall the payments after the fraud was discovered). Lord Leggatt, with whom the other Justices agree, gives the court's judgment.	The type of fraud which occurred in this case is known as "authorised push payment" (APP) fraud - so called because the victim is induced by fraudulent means to authorise their bank to send a payment to a bank account controlled by the fraudster [8]. Whether victims of such frauds should be left to bear the loss themselves or whether banks which have made or received the payments on behalf of customers should be required to reimburse victims of such crimes is a question of social policy for regulators, government and ultimately for Parliament to consider [6], [22]-[24]. It is in fact now the subject of legislation. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023, which received Royal Assent on 29 June 2023, provides (in section 72) for a mandatory reimbursement scheme (although this scheme does not extend to international payments and therefore would not have applied to this case) [21].  The claim made by Mrs Philipp is based on her contract with the Bank. The contract between a bank and a customer who holds a current account is a very well-established type of contract. Certain obligations have come to be recognised by the common law (and sometimes statute) as obligations implied by law in contracts of this type. These can be added to or altered by express agreement [26]. It would be possible for a bank to agree that it is not to carry out a payment instruction given by its customer if it believes, or has reasonable grounds for believing, that the customer has been tricked by a third party into authorising the payment. But the standard terms of business on which Barclays expressly agrees to provide its services do not contain an express term of this kind [4], [111]-[114]. Mrs Philipp argues that no express term is needed because such a duty is either already recognised by the common law, or can and should be recognised by a principled extension of the existing law, as an implied term of the contract between a bank and its customer [27].  The Court rejects this argument as inconsistent with the ordinary obligations owed by a bank to its customer. Provided the customer's account is in credit, the ordinary duty of the bank when instructed by its customer to make a payment from the account is to carry out the instruction and make the payment. In making the payment, the bank acts as the customer's agent. Its duty is strict. Unless otherwise agreed, the bank must execute the instruction and do so promptly. It is not for the bank to concern itself with the wisdom or risks of its customer's payment decisions [3], [28]-[30].  Mrs Philipp's argument relies heavily on the case of Barclays Bank plc v Quincecare Ltd [1992] 4 All ER 363. In this and other similar cases courts have held that a bank which receives an instruction from an agent of the customer to make a payment owes a duty to its customer not to carry out the instruction if the bank has reasonable grounds for believing that the agent is defrauding the customer by using the money for the agent's own purposes. But the explanation for these cases is that the authority of an agent to sign cheques or give other payment instructions on the customer's behalf does not include authority to defraud the customer [72]-[74], [90]-[91]. If the bank were to carry out the instruction it would therefore be making a payment which the customer has not actually authorised the bank to make. Even if the agent is acting in fraud of the customer and therefore does not actually have authority to give the instruction on behalf of the customer, the bank would still generally be entitled to rely on the agent as having apparent authority to do so; but not if the bank has reasonable grounds for believing that the instruction given by the agent is an attempt to defraud the customer and is therefore given without the customer's authority [86], [89]. In that case if the bank executes the instruction without first making inquiries to verify that the payment has actually been authorised by the customer and the instruction proves to have been given without the customer's authority, the bank will be in breach of duty. It will also be acting without actual or even apparent authority from the customer and will therefore not be entitled to debit the payment to the customer's account [90], [97].  This reasoning does not apply to cases like this one where there is no agent involved and the customer herself gives a payment instruction to the bank. In this situation the validity of the instruction is not in doubt. Provided the instruction is clear, no enquiries are needed to clarify or verify what the bank is authorized and required to do. Unless otherwise expressly agreed, the bank's duty is to execute the instruction and any refusal or failure to do so will be a breach of duty by the bank [5], [100].  Conclusions In this case each of the two payments made by the Bank was made after Mrs Philipp and her husband had visited a branch in person and given instructions to transfer the money from her account to a bank account in the UAE. They believed, having been duped by the fraudster, that they were transferring the money to "safe accounts". It is conceded that on the first occasion her husband told the cashier, falsely, that he had had previous dealings with the company to whose account the payment was being sent. On each occasion, before making the transfer, a representative of the Bank telephoned Mrs Philipp to seek her confirmation that she had made the transfer request and wished to proceed with it. On each occasion Mrs Philipp provided the required confirmation [12]. It is beyond dispute, therefore, that she unequivocally authorised and instructed the Bank to make the payments and, in these circumstances, it is impossible to say that the Bank owed her a duty not to comply with her instructions [5].  Mrs Philipp has an alternative claim that the Bank was in breach of duty in not acting promptly to try to recall the payments made to the UAE after being notified of the fraud. In the Court's view, the questions (i) whether the Bank owed such a duty and (ii) whether there was any realistic chance that the money would have been recovered if attempts had been made to recall the payments sooner cannot be decided without a fuller investigation of the facts. This alternative claim should therefore not have been summarily dismissed [115]-[119].			
2023	uksc-2022-0083	Zubaydah (Respondent) v Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and others (Appellants)	This appeal is concerned with the law applicable to torts (civil wrongs) alleged to have been committed by the UK Security Service and the UK Secret Intelligence Service (“the UK Services”). This is a preliminary issue and has been decided on the basis of the allegations made by the claimant, Mr Zubaydah. No findings of fact have been made. The claimant is a Palestinian national who has been detained without trial by the United States’ authorities since 2002 and is currently held in Guantánamo Bay. The claimant alleges that from at least May 2002 to at least 2006, whilst he was being rendered to, detained in and subjected to extreme mistreatment and torture at secret ‘black sites’ by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (“the CIA”), the UK Services sent numerous questions to the CIA for the purpose of eliciting information from the claimant. The claimant seeks compensation for personal injuries which he says were sustained in pursuit of the information sought by the UK services in CIA black site facilities in Thailand, Poland, Morocco, Lithuania, Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay (“the Six Countries”). He brought a claim naming the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (“the FCDO”), the Home Office and the Attorney General as defendants, on the basis that they are vicariously liable for the acts of the UK Services. The torts alleged against them under the law of England and Wales are misfeasance in public office, conspiracy to injure, trespass to the person, false imprisonment, and negligence. The High Court ordered that as a preliminary issue the law governing the torts should be identified. The claimant’s primary case is that the law of England and Wales applies whereas the defendants argue that the laws of each of the Six Countries apply. The High Court agreed with the defendants, but the Court of Appeal overturned that decision. The FCDO and others now appeal to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal by a majority. The applicable law is the law of England and Wales, not the law of the Six Countries. Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lord Stephens give the leading judgment, with which Lord Burrows and Lord Kitchin agree. Lord Sales gives a dissenting judgment.	The question of applicable law in this context is governed by sections 11 and 12 of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 (“PILA”) [50]. Section 11 establishes a general rule that the law applicable to a tort claim is the law of the country in which the events constituting the tort in question occurred. Where the elements of those events occurred in different countries, the applicable law in respect of personal injury is the law of the country in which the injury was sustained [51]. Section 12 states that the general rule can be displaced if, following a comparison of the significance of the factors connecting the tort with the country of the applicable law under the general rule and the significance of the factors connecting that tort to a different country, it is substantially more appropriate for the law of the other country to apply [53]. While an appeal court should be slow to interfere with the evaluation carried out by the trial judge under sections 11 and 12 of the PILA [57], the Court of Appeal was right in this case to identify errors in the High Court’s approach which were sufficiently significant to justify the Court of Appeal intervening and performing the evaluation for itself [79]. However, the Court of Appeal took an unduly narrow approach by focussing on the conduct of the UK Services rather than the specific torts which are alleged to have occurred and which on the facts of this case involved actions by both the UK Services and the CIA [80]-[81]. As a result of this error, it was necessary for the Supreme Court to conduct the evaluation required by sections 11 and 12 of the PILA for itself. The significance of the connection between the torts and the Six Countries is massively reduced by a number of factors. It is important to note that the Court’s judgment is based on the facts as alleged by the Claimant: it must always be borne in mind that the issue appealed is a preliminary issue and there have been no factual findings in the proceedings yet [13]. On the assumed facts, first the claimant was involuntarily present in the Six Countries because he had been unlawfully rendered there against his will in succession and could have had no reasonable expectation that the law of whichever location he was in (and which location was not known to him at the time) should apply to him [93]. Second, there is no suggestion that the UK Services were aware or ever took steps to find out where the claimant was being held [94]. Third, the rendition took place without reference to the laws of the Six Countries. Indeed, on the assumed facts an appropriate inference is that the locations were selected precisely to deny any access to local law or recourse to local courts [95]. Fourth, the fact that the claimant was held in six secret detention facilities in six different countries diminishes the significance of the law of any one of them [96]. Fifth, the claimant’s captors and interrogators were not agents of the Six Countries but of a third party, the United States [97]. There are also substantial factors which, on the assumed facts, connect the torts to the United Kingdom. First, the claim relates to torts allegedly committed by the UK Services [99]. Second, the events which constitute those alleged torts took place in part in England and in part by the CIA in the Six Countries [100]. Third, those alleged actions were taken by United Kingdom executive agencies acting in their official capacity in the purported exercise of the powers conferred to them under the law of England and Wales [101]. The majority concludes that it would be substantially more appropriate for the law of England and Wales to apply to this claim than the law of the Six Countries [102]-[103]. Lord Sales dissents and would allow the appeal. He does not consider that the High Court made any error of law in assessing whether the general rule should be displaced in this case [117]-[118]. Lord Sales agrees with the majority of the Supreme Court that the Court of Appeal was wrong to focus on the conduct of the UK Services rather than on the elements of the tort [122]. However, he concludes that it is not substantially more appropriate to apply the law of England and Wales to the claim and the laws of the Six Countries should apply [130]–[154]. He considers that it is highly significant that: (i) the claimant sustained his personal injuries and was imprisoned in the Six Countries [132]; and (ii) the CIA agents, who are the primary alleged wrongdoers, were present in the Six Countries and therefore subject to and answerable for their actions according to the laws of those countries [134]-[136]. Lord Sales considers that the fact that the UK Services were not the prime movers in the alleged scheme to seize, imprison and torture the claimant greatly diminishes the force of the connecting factor to England and Wales [137].			
2023	uksc-2022-0089-0093	James Hugh Allister and others (First Appellants) and Clifford Peeples (Second Appellant) v the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and others (Respondents)	These proceedings challenge the lawfulness of the Northern Ireland Protocol (“the Protocol”), which formed part of the agreement between the United Kingdom (“the UK”) and the European Union (“the EU”) regarding the UK’s exit from the EU. The Protocol was given legal effect by section 7A (“section 7A”) of the European (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“the 2018 Act”).  The Appellants rely on three grounds of appeal.  Ground One argues the Protocol is incompatible with Article VI of the Acts of Union 1800 (“Article VI”), the Acts which provided for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland. The trade limb of Article VI states “[His] Majesty's subjects of Great Britain and Ireland shall … be on the same footing … in respect of trade”. The Appellants argued the Protocol means the people of Ireland are not ‘on the same footing’ in respect of trade because, for example, the Protocol requires payment of a charge on goods which may be moved into the EU.  The first instance judge found that if there is any conflict between section 7A of the 2018 Act which incorporates the Protocol into UK law and the Acts of Union 1800, section 7A is to be preferred. The Court of Appeal found that Article VI is modified by the Protocol, via section 7A.  The Appellants also argued that the Crown does not have the power to make treaties that do not comply with Article VI. The lower courts found section 7A takes priority over any incompatible provisions of Article VI.  Ground Two relates to section 1(1) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (“the NIA 1998”). Section 1(1) of the NIA 1998 says Northern Ireland remains part of the UK unless the majority of the people of Northern Ireland consent via a poll. The Appellants argued there can be no substantial change to the status of Northern Ireland without this, the Protocol changed the status of Northern Ireland, and this was unlawful as the poll procedure was not followed.  The lower courts found section 1(1) of the NIA 1998 did not affect the legality of the changes made by the Protocol.  Ground Three challenges the lawfulness of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland (Democratic Consent Process) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (the “2020 Regulations”). Section 8C of the 2018 Act provided the power to make the 2020 Regulations. The 2020 Regulations permitted the Northern Ireland Assembly to vote on the continued application of Articles 5 to 10 of the Protocol without the need for cross-community support as required by section 42 of the NIA 1998. The Appellants argued that section 8C does not enable the making of regulations which are incompatible with the NIA 1998.  The lower courts found that deciding whether the Articles should continue to apply relates to the making of treaties and is within the competence of the UK Government. Cross-community support is not required.	The Court unanimously dismissed the appeals on all three grounds.  Ground One: Dismissed as Article VI is subject to the Protocol such that any parts which conflict with the Protocol are suspended.  Ground Two: Dismissed as section 1(1) of the NIA 1998 relates only to the right to determine whether Northern Ireland remains part of the UK or joins a united Ireland.  Ground Three: Dismissed as section 7A amended the existing law such that the system created by the 2020 Regulations was lawful without the requirement of cross-community support. The 2020 Regulations were lawfully made.	Ground One  The Court proceeds on the basis the Protocol does conflict with Article VI [54] following the findings of the lower courts [53].  First, the Protocol is incorporated into UK law by section 7A. Section 7A stipulates that all enactments are to have effect subject to section 7A. Consequently, Article VI is modified to the extent it conflicts with the Protocol via section 7A [65].  The debate about whether the Acts of Union and/or the Acts enabling the UK’s withdrawal from the EU are statutes of a constitutional character, is academic. The suspension, subjugation, or modification of rights contained in an earlier statute may be effected by express words in a later statute. A clear answer has been provided by Parliament in relation to any conflict between the Protocol and any other enactment. The Acts of Union and Article VI remain in place but are modified to the extent and for the period during which the Protocol applies [66].  Second, Parliament, by enacting the 2018 Act and the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, authorised the making of the Protocol. The clear intention of Parliament in enacting these Acts was to permit the Crown to make the Protocol [73].  Ground Two  The Supreme Court has previously held that section 1(1) of the NIA 1998 does not regulate any change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland other than the right to determine whether to remain part of the UK or become part of a united Ireland. There is no reason to depart from this finding. The Appellants’ submissions regarding a different meaning are incorrect [84].  Ground Three  The requirement of cross-community support is imposed by section 42 of the NIA 1998. The 2020 Regulations inserted section 56A and Schedule 6A into the NIA 1998 [104]. Schedule 6A sets out a system called a ‘consent resolution’, which allows the Northern Ireland Assembly to vote on the continued application of Articles 5 to 10 of the Protocol [104 – 105]. Schedule 6A states that section 41 of the NIA 1998 does not apply in relation to consent resolutions. The effect of this is that a ‘consent resolution’ can be passed without the requirement of cross-community support [106].  The Court acknowledged the potential force in the Appellants’ argument that cross-community support is still required for matters outside the Assembly’s legislative competence. However, all enactments are to be read subject to section 7A. Section 7A had already modified section 42 of the NIA 1998. The 2020 Regulations were compatible with section 42 of the NIA 1998 as modified. There is therefore no incompatibility between the 2020 Regulations and section 42 of the NIA 1998 [108].  Section 8C of the 2018 Act provided the power to make the 2020 Regulations. It is clear from the wording of section 8C that Parliament intended to confer the power to make regulations which amend primary legislation [109].			
2023	uksc-2022-0102	R (on the application of Imam) (Respondent) v London Borough of Croydon (Appellant)	The issue in this appeal is whether, and if so in what way, a local authority’s lack of financial or other resources should be taken into consideration when a court is deciding whether to grant a mandatory order against the local authority to enforce its statutory duty towards a homeless individual under section 193(2) of Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996 (the “Act”). The respondent, Ms Imam, is disabled and has to use a wheelchair. She has three children. In 2014 she applied to the local housing authority, London Borough of Croydon (“LBC”), for assistance as a homeless person. Part 7 of the Act makes provision for assistance to be provided to the homeless by local housing authorities. Section 193(2) sets out the main housing duty owed to persons with priority needs who are not homeless intentionally. LBC has provided Ms Imam with temporary accommodation comprising a three-bedroom house (the “Property”) since September 2014 under Part 7 of the Act. LBC accepts that (a) the Property is not suitable accommodation, having regard to Ms Imam’s disability, and (b) it is in breach of section 193(2) of the Act by not offering her suitable alternative accommodation. Part 6 of the Act is concerned with allocation of housing accommodation on a secure, non-temporary basis. Ms Imam is on the waiting list for re-housing in a wheelchair adapted property under Part 6. Ms Imam brought a claim for judicial review of LBC’s conduct in relation to her. She sought a mandatory order to require LBC to secure suitable accommodation for occupation by her and her household under Part 7 (ground 1); declaratory relief and damages for breach of the Equality Act 2010 (ground 2); and an order requiring LBC to reassess her priority on its housing register under Part 6 (ground 3). The High Court allowed the claim in part on ground 3 but dismissed it on grounds 1 and 2. The Court of Appeal granted permission to appeal on ground 1 only. It allowed her appeal on the basis that the High Court had considered budgetary constraints to which LBC was subject to be a valid excuse for LBC’s non- compliance with its statutory duty under section 193(2); it was for LBC to demonstrate reasons why a mandatory order should not be granted against it to require it to comply with its duty to provide Ms Imam with suitable accommodation; and it was appropriate to remit the case to the High Court for that issue to be examined in greater detail. LBC now appeals to the Supreme Court.	The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. The case is to be remitted to the High Court for further consideration with fresh evidence. Lord Sales gives the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.	The starting point is that LBC is subject to a public law duty imposed by Parliament by statute which is not qualified in any relevant way by reference to available resources. The substance of a duty imposed on a public authority might be undermined if, when breached, courts routinely declined to enforce performance through a mandatory order on the ground of insufficient resources. However, remedies in public law are discretionary and the court should only grant a mandatory order where that course is properly justified [39]-[43]. The court takes a number of factors into account, including the availability of alternative remedies, whether compliance with a mandatory order would be impossible, and the additional impact of a mandatory order such as its potential to disrupt existing plans for the allocation of the authority’s resources [44]-[52]. Where a housing authority like LBC is in breach of its duty under section 193(2) the onus is on the authority to explain to the court why a mandatory order should not be made to compel it to comply with its duty [53]. LBC in its evidence has not sufficiently explained its situation regarding suitably adapted properties it might have in its portfolio to allow a court to assess whether a mandatory order requiring it to provide such a property should be refused [57]. If LBC in fact held such properties in its portfolio, it had a choice whether to assign them for allocation under Part 6 of the Act or to use them to meet its duties under Part 7. In making this choice, it is relevant that allocation of suitable accommodation under Part 7 in a case like that of Ms Imam is a matter of binding legal obligation whereas to make properties available for the purposes of allocation under Part 6 is a matter of discretion, so priority should be given to meeting obligations under Part 7 [55], [57]. Where Parliament imposes a statutory duty on a public authority to provide a specific benefit or service, it generally does so on the footing that the authority must be taken to have the resources available to comply with that duty. A court is not entitled to absolve an authority in any general way from complying with such a duty by reason of unparticularised claims that the resources available to it are insufficient [59]. On the other hand, for reasons to do with the democratic authority and institutional competence which a housing authority enjoys by comparison with a court, the Supreme Court rejects the further submission by Ms Imam that a mandatory order should be made even if it transpires that LBC has no suitable property currently available which it could use to house Ms Imam and her family, so that it would be required to buy in such a property. Such an order would have the practical effect of requiring an authority to divert funding from allocations already made in its annual budget across the whole range of functions imposed on it by Parliament which it has to fulfil, and such a degree of disruption of the authority’s decision-making would not be justified [60]-[62]. The Supreme Court gives guidance in relation to the exercise of a court’s discretion as to remedy in this kind of case. First, if there is a general contingency fund to deal with unexpected calls for expenditure, LBC should explain why this cannot be used to meet its legal obligation to Ms Imam [66]. Second, it is relevant for a court to consider the length of time an authority has been on notice of, and failed to take the opportunity to react to, a problem in relation to the non-performance of its duty. A court cannot provide encouragement for what would amount to a settled position of the authority to act in disregard of the duty imposed on it by Parliament [67]. Third, a court should consider the extent of the impact on the individual to whom the duty is owed. The less serious the impact on the individual from non-compliance, the less compelling will be the grounds for making an immediate mandatory order with potentially disruptive effect [68]. Fourth, if there is no sign that the authority is moving to rectify the situation and satisfy the individual’s rights, that is a factor pointing in favour of the making of a mandatory order [69]. Fifth, a court should take care not to give a claimant undue priority over others who may have an equal or better claim compared to the claimant. In this respect, however, it remains important to draw a distinction between a mere discretion to allocate property under Part 6 and the statutory duty owed under section 193(2) of Part 7. Upon remittal of the case to the High Court, further evidence should be provided by LBC and Ms Imam. LBC should submit proposals to the court on how to proceed in respect of any competition for suitable properties between individuals, including Ms Imam, who are owed a duty under section 193(2) [70].
